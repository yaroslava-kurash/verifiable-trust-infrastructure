# Guard against the "Cargo.lock pins a STALE crates.io copy of one of our own
# workspace crates" trap that kept the Publish job red on main.
#
# This is the sibling failure to the one check-version-bumps.sh catches. There,
# the version bump was *missing*. Here the bump is present and correct, and the
# release still breaks.
#
# What happened: a transitive DEV-dependency pulls one of our own crates back in
# from crates.io —
#
#   vtc-service [dev-dependencies]
#     -> affinidi-messaging-test-mediator
#       -> affinidi-messaging-mediator
#         -> vta-sdk   (registry, NOT the workspace path copy)
#
# so Cargo.lock carries TWO vta-sdk nodes: the workspace path copy at the local
# version, and a registry copy pinned at whatever was current when that
# dependency was last resolved.
#
# The publish workflow runs `cargo publish --locked`. For a dependent crate
# (pnm-cli), cargo's verification build swaps the workspace path dep for a
# registry one — and `--locked` makes it reuse the lockfile's already-pinned
# registry node rather than resolving the newest match. So pnm-cli 0.11.2 was
# verified against vta-sdk 0.19.11 even though the same run had just published
# vta-sdk 0.19.12, and the build failed with E0599 on `TspPingSession::
# probe_send` — an API that only exists in 0.19.12. pnm-cli then sat unpublished
# for three releases while the workspace build stayed green the whole time,
# because the path deps always saw the new source.
#
# Dropping `--locked` would "fix" this by making releases non-reproducible.
# Instead this guard keeps the lockfile honest: whenever a publishable workspace
# crate also appears in Cargo.lock as a registry package, the two versions must
# agree. Refreshing the pin is a one-line `cargo update` that the PR author runs
# alongside the version bump.
#
# One case is NOT a failure: a PR that bumps a workspace crate sets the local
# version to something not yet on crates.io, so the pin CANNOT be refreshed —
# `cargo update --precise <new>` fails with "no matching package". Demanding
# equality there makes this guard and check-version-bumps.sh mutually
# unsatisfiable: one requires the bump, the other forbids its consequence. So
# an unpublished local version is reported and allowed; the publish workflow
# refreshes the pin immediately after publishing the crate, which is the only
# moment the refresh is actually possible.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-lockfile-self-pins.sh
# Portable to macOS bash 3.2 / BSD userland.
