//! Consent records — ISO/IEC 27560 consent receipts expressed with the W3C
//! DPV vocabulary (task 1.3.5,
//! `docs/05-design-notes/vti-credential-architecture.md` §7a).
//!
//! Consent is a **first-class, persisted, signed, withdrawable, auditable
//! record** — not an ephemeral parameter. Every disclosure the VTA makes on
//! the holder's behalf is gated by one of these records. The shape follows a
//! pragmatic 27560/DPV subset: a `dpv:ConsentRecord` naming the holder as
//! `dpv:hasDataSubject`, a `dpv:hasProcess` describing *what* (the reveal set
//! `dpv:hasPersonalData`), *to whom* (`dpv:hasRecipient`), *why*
//! (`dpv:hasPurpose`), *how* (`dpv:hasProcessing = dpv:Disclose`), and *until
//! when* (`dpv:hasStorageCondition.dct:valid`), plus a `dpv:hasStatus` event
//! log (`dpv:ConsentGiven`, later possibly `dpv:ConsentWithdrawn`).
//!
//! ## Non-repudiation from day one
//!
//! Every record carries a holder `eddsa-jcs-2022` Data Integrity proof,
//! signed with the holder's VTA-managed key. So a consent record is a
//! **signed consent receipt**: the holder cannot later deny it, and any party
//! can verify it offline. The proof is the non-repudiation anchor — [`get`]
//! re-verifies it on every read, and [`authorizes`] is only ever called on a
//! record that [`get`] has already verified.
//!
//! ## Storage
//!
//! Records live in the existing `vault` keyspace under the disjoint
//! `consent:<id>` key namespace — mirroring the `cred:<id>` (primary) and
//! `idx:<…>` (secondary index) namespaces the credential store already uses,
//! and the `vault:<id>` namespace the password-manager `VaultEntry` records
//! use. The whole record value (which carries the holder DID, the verifier
//! DID, and the reveal set) is encrypted at rest by the keyspace's
//! AES-256-GCM wrapper.
//!
//! ## Security / privacy invariants (`vti-credential-architecture.md` §14)
//!
//! - [`list`] / [`get`] are the **holder's own local audit surface** — never
//!   a cross-trust-boundary enumeration. They scan only this VTA's own
//!   `consent:` namespace; there is no wire endpoint that returns them.
//! - [`authorizes`] returns `true` **only** for a record that is bound to the
//!   credential being presented (`dct:source` matches — consent is
//!   per-credential, §13), is given (latest status `dpv:ConsentGiven`, not
//!   withdrawn), unexpired (`dct:valid > now`), whose `dpv:hasRecipient`
//!   matches the verifier, and whose `dpv:hasPersonalData` is a superset of
//!   the requested claims. An expired or withdrawn record authorizes
//!   **nothing**.
//! - [`withdraw`] appends a re-signed `dpv:ConsentWithdrawn` status event;
//!   the record stays for audit but no longer authorizes disclosure.
