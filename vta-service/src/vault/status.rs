//! Holder-side status refresh for held credentials (task 1.6,
//! `docs/05-design-notes/vti-credential-architecture.md` §5 "Track validity",
//! §14 invariant 5).
//!
//! A stored credential may carry a `credentialStatus`
//! ([`BitstringStatusListEntry`][w3c]): a status-list credential URL plus an
//! index into that list's bitstring. This module is the **holder side** of
//! revocation: it resolves the referenced status list, decodes the bitstring
//! via the `affinidi-status-list` crate, reads the bit at the credential's
//! `statusListIndex`, and flips the stored envelope's
//! [`CredentialStatus`] to [`CredentialStatus::Revoked`] when the bit is set —
//! so search ([`super::query`]) can exclude it and present ([`super::present`])
//! continues to refuse it.
//!
//! [w3c]: https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/
//!
//! ## Scope (deliberately holder-side only)
//!
//! This task is the *consumer* of issuer status. It does **not** stand up the
//! VTA-as-issuer status-list allocator, self-minted revocability, or the
//! `status_lists` keyspace (§15) — that is a separate, larger follow-up. Here
//! the VTA is purely a holder reading some *other* issuer's published list.
//!
//! ## No live network in this layer
//!
//! Resolution is behind the injected [`StatusListResolver`] trait. The trait
//! takes the `statusListCredential` URL and returns the decoded-ready
//! [`ResolvedStatusList`] (the encoded bitstring + its size + purpose).
//! Production wires an HTTP-fetching, list-credential-verifying resolver;
//! tests provide a mock, so the refresh path has **no hard network
//! dependency** and is fully unit-testable. Fetching, caching, and
//! verifying the *status-list credential's own* issuer signature are the
//! resolver's responsibility, not this module's.
//!
//! ## Security invariants upheld (§14 invariant 5)
//!
//! - **A set bit revokes.** When the resolved bitstring's bit at the
//!   credential's index is `1`, the stored status becomes
//!   [`CredentialStatus::Revoked`] and is persisted. Combined with the
//!   search exclusion in [`super::query`], a revoked credential can no longer
//!   be surfaced.
//! - **Fail closed on a `revocation` list, fail safe on transient errors.**
//!   A malformed entry, an out-of-bounds index, or a decode failure is
//!   surfaced as an error to the caller rather than silently leaving the
//!   credential `Valid`; the caller decides retry/alert policy. The status is
//!   only ever *written* on a definitive read.
//! - **Suspension is not permanent revocation.** A `suspension`-purpose list
//!   with the bit set marks the credential [`CredentialStatus::Revoked`] for
//!   the duration (search/present must not surface a suspended credential);
//!   a later refresh with the bit clear restores it to
//!   [`CredentialStatus::Valid`]. A `revocation`-purpose set bit is terminal:
//!   once revoked, a subsequent clear read does **not** un-revoke it.
