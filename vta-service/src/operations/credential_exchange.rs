//! Holder-side credential-exchange operations (Phase 3, spec §6) — the VTA's
//! side of `credential-exchange/*`: receiving issued credentials and answering
//! a verifier's DCQL query against the held vault.
//!
//! - [`receive_issued_credential`] (task 3.3) — the **credential vault's first
//!   wire exposure**: a `credential-exchange/issue` message
//!   ([`vta_sdk::protocols::credential_exchange`]) carries an OID4VCI credential
//!   response, and this infers the format and stores it through the
//!   format-agnostic [`crate::vault::receive`] (SD-JWT-VC + W3C Data-Integrity,
//!   tasks 3.1a/3.1b).
//! - [`match_vault`] / [`match_held`] (task 3.5, query→match) — run a verifier's
//!   DCQL query locally over the held credentials ([`match_vault`] gathers them
//!   from the live vault via the type index, no enumeration; [`match_held`]
//!   matches an explicit set), returning which satisfy it and the claim paths to
//!   disclose.
//! - [`present_query`] (tasks 3.5c/3.5d) — the full holder `query → present`
//!   path: match, then under the holder's [`ConsentPolicy`] either present
//!   **every** matched credential ([`present_matched_set`], one consent record +
//!   ACL-gated holder key per credential, OID4VP DCQL `vp_token` keyed by
//!   credential-query id) for a **trusted** verifier, or defer with
//!   [`PresentOutcome::ConsentRequired`] for an out-of-band approval.
//!
//! ## Scope of this slice
//! - **SD-JWT-VC** — fully wired (the issuer `did:key` is resolved inside
//!   `receive`).
//! - **W3C Data-Integrity** from a **`did:key`** issuer — fully wired (resolved
//!   locally, no I/O).
//! - **W3C Data-Integrity** from a **`did:webvh` / `did:web`** issuer — wired via
//!   the app-state DID resolver (the VTC issues under `did:webvh`). The proof's
//!   `verificationMethod` is resolved and **bound to the credential `issuer`**.
//! - A **`sealed`** bundle (the unknown-holder / invite case) is deferred to the
//!   sealed-issuance slice (3.6).
