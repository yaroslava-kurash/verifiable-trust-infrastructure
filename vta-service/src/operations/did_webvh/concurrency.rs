//! Optimistic-concurrency helpers for `WebvhDidRecord` mutations.
//!
//! Several `did_webvh` operations follow a load-then-modify-then-store
//! pattern that is susceptible to lost-update races when two operators
//! (or one operator + a bot, or the daemon + a rollback) hit the same
//! DID concurrently:
//!
//! - `register_did_with_server` reads `record.server_id` and rejects
//!   if it's not `"serverless"`, then writes the new server_id +
//!   mnemonic. Two concurrent calls both pass the serverless check
//!   then both write — the second clobbers the first, the local view
//!   ends up pointing at one of two different upstream hosts that
//!   each think they own the DID.
//! - `rotate_did_webvh_keys` reads `record.next_fragment_id`, derives
//!   N keys from `[next_fragment_id, next_fragment_id + N)`, then
//!   bumps the counter. Two concurrent rotates derive overlapping
//!   fragment ids; only one record-write survives, so the loser has
//!   minted keys whose `#key-N` references collide with the winner's.
//!
//! `update_did_webvh` already had its own ad-hoc within-operation
//! check on `log_entry_count`. The helpers in this module factor that
//! pattern out so every record-mutating op shares one CAS surface,
//! and so the next op the workspace adds can't quietly miss it.
//!
//! ## Pattern
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let record = webvh_store::get_did(&webvh_ks, did).await?...;
//! let snapshot = RecordSnapshot::capture(&record);
//! // ... perform expensive work that may mutate the record locally ...
//! // ... but BEFORE the final store, re-load and assert nothing
//! // ... else changed the on-disk record:
//! let current = webvh_store::get_did(&webvh_ks, did).await?...;
//! snapshot.assert_unchanged(&current)?;
//! webvh_store::store_did(&webvh_ks, &record).await?;
//! ```
//!
//! The assertion is conservative — `log_entry_count`, `updated_at`,
//! and `server_id` are all part of the snapshot, so any mutation a
//! concurrent op might have made surfaces as `RaceDetected`. False
//! positives (e.g. operator B touched the record but the change is
//! benign for our purposes) are vastly preferable to silent overwrites.

///   appended log entry; the strongest signal that someone else has
///   mutated the DID.
/// - `updated_at` — touched by every record mutation, including the
///   ones that *don't* append a log entry (`register_did_with_server`,
///   `rotate_did_webvh_keys`'s `next_fragment_id` bump). Catches
///   concurrent ops that don't grow the log.
/// - `server_id` — the serverless→server-managed transition is a
///   one-way state change that affects which transport future ops
///   take. Pin it so a concurrent register can't quietly slip a
///   different server_id underneath us.
///
/// `mnemonic`, `next_fragment_id`, and `pre_rotation_count` are NOT
/// part of the snapshot — they're owned-mutated by the op itself and
/// are expected to differ between snapshot and final write.
