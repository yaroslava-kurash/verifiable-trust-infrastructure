//! Task-execution consent — the data layer behind the PDP's `requireConsent`
//! disposition.
//!
//! When a policy returns `requireConsent`, a privileged task can't proceed until
//! one or more named approvers have signed off on **this exact task**. The
//! binding is a deterministic digest of the task URI and its payload (RFC 8785
//! JCS + SHA-256), so the approval a re-submitted task consumes provably
//! concerns the same request — an approver can't be tricked into signing one
//! payload while a different one executes, nor into approving a benign task URI
//! whose payload happens to canonicalize like a destructive one's.
//!
//! Two records in the `task_consent` keyspace:
//! - [`PendingTaskConsent`] (`pending:<digest>`) — an in-flight request
//!   accumulating approver signatures.
//! - [`TaskConsentGrant`] (`grant:<digest>:<requester>`) — a completed
//!   authorization the re-submitting requester consumes single-use.
//!
//! This mirrors the step-up "reject → approve → re-submit" loop, but the
//! authorization is bound to the payload digest rather than the session.
