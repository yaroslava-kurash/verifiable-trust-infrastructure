//! Dry-run the handler a task is about to invoke, and report what it would do.
//!
//! This is the bridge between the PDP's `requireConsent` and the plan/apply
//! split in the operations layer. When a policy says a task needs human
//! approval, *something* has to show the human what they are approving — and the
//! submitted payload is the wrong thing to show them, because a payload says
//! what was asked for while only the code about to run knows what will happen.
//!
//! A handler with no planner yields `None`. That is not "no consequences": it is
//! "the consequences could not be determined", and the consent surface is
//! required to say so rather than present the task as harmless.
