### Changed

- **audit**: One construction point for the audit sink, and the prerequisites for chaining it ([#1412](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1412))

* refactor(audit): build the keyspace audit sink in one place

  The workspace built the same sink over the same keyspace in
  thirty-one places, including three times inside one function
  (run_create_did_webvh, which already had one in scope two hundred
  lines above the other two). Each was somewhere a later change to what
  a VTA's audit writes would have to be found and repeated.

  There is now one constructor, vta_audit::shared_keyspace_sink, and
  every caller goes through it. A server still takes its sink from
  AppState — that path was already correct, and its comment already said
  why. The factory is for the callers with no AppState to take one from:
  offline CLI commands, setup, sweepers and tests.

  No behaviour change. The next change to this subsystem — writing
  chained envelopes rather than flat rows — is now one edit instead of a
  search.



## [0.3.4](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sweepers-v0.3.3...vta-sweepers-v0.3.4) — 2026-09-07

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sweepers-v0.3.1...vta-sweepers-v0.3.2) — 2026-08-29


## [0.3.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sweepers-v0.3.0...vta-sweepers-v0.3.1) — 2026-08-28


## [0.3.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sweepers-v0.2.0...vta-sweepers-v0.3.0) — 2026-08-26


### Added

- **audit**: Make the audit destination a deployment choice, not a protocol one ([#1049](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1049))

`AuditLogEntry` is `{id, timestamp, action, actor, resource, outcome, channel,
  contextId, detail}` — no signature, no hash chain. The log corroborates what
  happened; it cannot prove it, and a compromised VTA can rewrite its own history.
  The canonical `AuditEnvelope` already names the members that would change that
  (`prevHash`, `entryHash`, `schemaVersion`) and records why this maintainer omits
  them: its log is flat and unchained.

  This does not add tamper-evidence, deliberately. It adds the seam, so an
  operator who needs a stronger guarantee implements one — an append-only file, a
  transparency log, a blockchain anchor, a hash chain filling in those three
  members — without the VTA committing to any scheme. Closes #1031.

  ## The shape



## [0.2.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sweepers-v0.1.4...vta-sweepers-v0.2.0) — 2026-08-20


### Added

- **vta**: Dedup keyed Trust Tasks on an idempotency key ([#1011](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1011))

A client that retries a timed-out request is doing the right thing. The
  dangerous case is the one where the VTA processed it and only the reply
  was lost, because the retry then produces a second durable effect —
  `webvh/dids/create` being the sharp example, where auto-assigned paths
  mean the retry mints a *different* DID and the first stays published
  with nobody holding a reference to it.

  The existing `trust_tasks::replay` layer cannot catch that. It keys on
  `(actor, envelope-id)` and every SDK path mints a fresh `urn:uuid:` per
  attempt, so a genuine retry sails past it. Its own module docs name this
  work as the deliberate follow-up.

  ## Built on the store that was already here

### Added

- **release**: Publish vta-service and its closure again ([#962](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/962))

* feat(release): publish vta-service and its closure again

  #938 unpublished `vta-service` and the twelve subsystem crates behind it,
  on the finding that nothing external depended on them. The audit read
  normal dependencies. `openvtc-core` depends on `vta-service` as a
  **dev-dependency**, for `test_support::MockVta` — an in-process VTA its
  end-to-end tests run against. That harness boots the real service, so no
  client crate can stand in for it.

  Unpublishing did not merely freeze the crate. It broke it.

  `vti-common` re-exports `vta_sdk::acl::{ActScope, ApproveScope,
  ContextDirection}` as its own public API, so **a re-export makes the
  re-exported crate's version part of your public API**: any graph
  combining `vti-common` with another `vta-sdk` consumer must resolve one
  `vta-sdk`. The frozen `vta-service` 0.14.37 asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21`
  while `vti-common` has moved to `^0.23`. A downstream `cargo update`
  resolves both and `vta-service` fails to compile with

    expected `vti_common::acl::ApproveScope`,
       found `vta_sdk::acl::ApproveScope`

  at ten call sites — which is how this surfaced, in openvtc #213. Nothing
  downstream can fix that; only a release that moves the requirements
  together can.

  So the thirteen manifests go back to the workspace default. The cost is
  the closure — twelve subsystem crates return to crates.io, which is
  exactly what #938 set out to stop. Taken deliberately over the
  alternatives: yanking the published copies breaks OpenVTC's tests with no
  replacement, and leaving them up ships a crate on the registry that
  cannot be built.

  **On release ordering.** `cargo publish --dry-run -p vta-service` fails
  today, and will until the closure is on the registry: packaging strips
  path deps, so `vta-keys = "0.2"` resolves the *published* 0.2.1, which
  still asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21` — two nodes, same error. That resolves
  itself in the release, which publishes in dependency order: every
  subsystem crate in this workspace already requires `vta-sdk = "0.23"`, so
  once they upload, `vta-service` verifies against them. Crates whose
  dependencies are all published already dry-run clean (verified on
  `vta-keyspaces` and `vta-config`).

  Docs updated to match: CLAUDE.md, RELEASING.md and the release-plz.toml
  header all said 7-of-21. They now say 20-of-26, name the six that stay
  internal, and record the rule the audit missed — check dev-dependencies,
  in sibling repos, before unpublishing anything.



### Build & CI

- **release**: Adopt release-plz, publish 7 crates instead of 21 ([#938](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/938))

Merging and releasing were the same act. publish.yml fired on every push to
  main and shipped whatever versions were newly present, and a CI guard required
  the version bump to live in the feature PR — so every PR was a release
  decision, taken by whoever opened it, days before it merged. Two open PRs
  touching one crate wrote the same number into the same line of the same
  Cargo.toml, and the second to merge had to rebase, renumber, and fix a
  changelog entry that had gone stale. #932/#936/#937 hit it three times in one
  afternoon.
