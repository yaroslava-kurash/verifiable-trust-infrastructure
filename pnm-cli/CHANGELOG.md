## [0.18.0](https://github.com/yaroslava-kurash/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.17.5...pnm-cli-v0.18.0) — 2026-09-21


### Added

- **persona**: Say who holds an old value, where an edit landed, and what a context may call a face ([#1597](https://github.com/yaroslava-kurash/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1597))


## [0.17.5](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.17.4...pnm-cli-v0.17.5) — 2026-09-20

## [0.17.3](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.17.2...pnm-cli-v0.17.3) — 2026-09-18


### Added

- **sealed-transfer**: A template-bootstrap variant that can carry a second signing key ([#1556](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1556))

* fix(did-templates): a key slot beyond the historical pair, and the literal it used to publish

  `slot_var`'s `{SLOT}_KEY_MB` rule is mechanical, and before this it was
  mechanical in one direction only. A `schemaVersion` 2 template could *declare* a
  third key slot — a post-quantum signing key beside the classical pair, which is
  the shape a hybrid-credential issuer needs — and then could not be loaded,
  because the placeholder that slot's own rule produces was rejected:

      Invalid("undeclared placeholder(s) { PQ_SIGNING_KEY_MB } in document
               — add them to requiredVars or optionalVars")

  Only `SIGNING_KEY_MB` and `KA_KEY_MB` were ambient, because only those two are
  in `RESERVED_VARS`. So `keys` at schemaVersion 2 ([#1530](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1530)) could express exactly
  the pair it was introduced to move beyond.

  ## Following the error's advice published a literal into a write-once log

  The advice is the defect. `optionalVars` supplies a **default**, and the
  renderer substitutes a default for any name the caller did not supply — and the
  minting flow does not supply a slot's key under a name it has never heard of.
  So declaring `PQ_SIGNING_KEY_MB` to get past the rejection passed validation
  *and rendered*:

      {
        "id": "did:webvh:x#key-2",
        "type": "Multikey",
        "publicKeyMultibase": "PLACEHOLDER-NEVER-SUBSTITUTED"
      }

  — inside `assertionMethod`, in a `did:webvh` log that is signed once and cannot
  be re-signed. `check_key_slots` already refuses a slot the document never
  publishes: a key minted and thrown away. This is the same failure wearing the
  other hat, a key published and never minted, and it arrived through the one door
  that check does not watch.

  ## What changes

  - `DidTemplate::slot_vars()` — the placeholder names the declared slots occupy,
    built from `key_slots()` rather than a second fixed list. For a v1 template it
    is exactly the two already in `RESERVED_VARS`, so v1 behaviour is untouched;
    it is what lets a v2 template name a third slot at all.
  - `check_placeholders_declared` treats those names as ambient. An author cannot
    declare a value they have no way to know.
  - `check_slot_vars_not_declared` refuses the reverse — a slot's placeholder in
    `requiredVars` or `optionalVars` — naming the slot and saying why. A v1
    template still gets `ReservedVar` from the check that runs first, unchanged.
  - An undeclared placeholder that is *shaped* like a slot's is told to declare a
    **slot**, not a variable. The generic advice pointed at exactly what the new
    check refuses; an error that recommends the defect is worse than no error.

  ## The state this leaves

  A third slot is expressible, and a VTA that cannot yet mint for it fails at
  render with `Unresolved` naming the placeholder — rather than emitting a
  document with a hole in it. Wiring derivation to the `keys` block is the next
  change; until then the loud failure is the correct one.

  Found while tracing what stands between a VTC and a second signing key: nothing
  in the chain from template to `LocalSigner::with_additional_key` could carry one.



## [0.17.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.17.1...pnm-cli-v0.17.2) — 2026-09-17


## [0.17.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.17.0...pnm-cli-v0.17.1) — 2026-09-17


### Added

- **keys**: An operator can create a post-quantum key, and see which axis it protects ([#1535](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1535))

Two gaps, one of which made everything upstream unusable in practice.

  ## `keys create` could not make a PQC key

  The VTA has been able to derive ML-DSA-44 and ML-DSA-65 since the BIP-32 work
  landed, and since the derived key started carrying its own algorithm it records
  them correctly too. But the CLI matched exactly three strings:

      "ed25519" | "x25519" | "p256" => ..., other => Err("unknown key type")

  So every post-quantum capability in the stack sat behind a front door that could
  not ask for it. `--key-type mldsa44` now works.

  `keys import` deliberately still refuses them, and says why. The VTA validates
  imported key material per algorithm and has no ML-DSA checker, so offering it
  here would take an operator's private key and fail at the far end. The refusal
  names the gap and points at `keys create`, rather than the generic "expected
  ed25519, x25519, or p256" — which reads as "no such algorithm" and would send
  someone looking in the wrong place.

  ## "Is this post-quantum?" has no single answer

  `QuantumPosture` makes that structural rather than a matter of remembering.
  Signature resistance and confidentiality resistance are separate facts, they
  migrate on different timetables, and today the second is false almost
  everywhere: an identity can sign with ML-DSA-44 while still agreeing keys with
  X25519.

  Collapsing those into one badge is wrong in the direction that matters. A reader
  shown "post-quantum" for such an identity has been told its recorded traffic is
  safe from harvest-now-decrypt-later, and it is not. So every label names its
  axis — `mldsa44 (post-quantum signing)`, `x25519 (classical key agreement)` —
  and a test holds them to it.

  There is deliberately no `PostQuantumKeyAgreement` variant. Nothing a DID
  document publishes can answer that axis affirmatively today: the hybrid KEM this
  stack uses lives in the TSP transport, not in a verification method. Adding the
  variant before that is true would let a renderer claim something nothing can do.



### Fixed

- **tsp**: Form a relationship before the health Trust-Ping ([#1537](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1537))

The session-identity TSP probe sent the ping application message with no prior relationship, so the VTA correctly dropped it under Rev 3 §7.2.2 ("discarded: no relationship") and the ping timed out — the failure that opened this workstream, still live because the client never invited.

  Call the already-present (but unwired) TspPingSession::relate before the pings. The VTA's answering arm (VTI#1525) accepts the invite, and an invite already admits the messages that follow it (§3.6), so the ping is admitted and the pong returns. relate is idempotent by state read, and on repeat runs the client's fresh invite over the VTA's persisted relationship (VTI#1531) is handled by the D2 reconcile transition (affinidi-tsp 0.2.1). The cold --fresh probe is unchanged (it deliberately tests the relationship-free §3 send via probe_send).



## [0.17.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.16.7...pnm-cli-v0.17.0) — 2026-09-16


### Added

- **backup**: Back up a DIDComm/TSP-only VTA with the chunkedTrustTask algorithm ([#1522](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1522))

* build(deps): trust-tasks-rs 0.21.1, the release carrying the chunked backup specs

  0.21.1 is the first release with `vta/backup/get-chunk/1.0`,
  `put-chunk/1.0`, `initiate-{export,import}/1.1` and
  `finalize-import/1.1` (trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#474). A
  dispatched URI the registry has no schema for fails
  `every_served_uri_has_a_published_spec_or_is_tracked_debt`, so the floor
  moves with the tasks that need it.

- **vta-service**: Tune the VTA's rate limits at runtime ([#1519](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1519))

* feat(vta-service)!: tune the VTA's rate limits at runtime

  The per-IP limiters were tower_governor layers built once with the router, so
  changing a quota needed a config edit and a restart — exactly when an operator
  facing 429s can least afford one.

  The limiters are now our own axum middleware over governor's keyed limiter
  (already in the graph via tower_governor, whose spoof-safe client-IP key
  extractors are reused unchanged). The running service reads the four [server]
  quotas from the shared config on every request and swaps in fresh buckets when
  a quota changes; a change resets that limiter's buckets, and a patch that
  leaves a quota alone keeps them. trust_xff stays restart-only. The 429 contract
  is unchanged.

  rate_limit_interval_secs, rate_limit_burst, did_log_rate_limit_interval_secs
  and did_log_rate_limit_burst are registered in the config registry as mutable
  integer keys, applied live and persisted to config.toml: intervals 1-3600,
  bursts 1-10000, super-admin only, through config/patch like every other key.
  Their names come from vta_sdk::rate_limit, which the 429 hints also use.
  pnm and cnm `config update` gain --rate-limit-interval-secs,
  --rate-limit-burst, --did-log-rate-limit-interval-secs and
  --did-log-rate-limit-burst; `config get` shows the keys.

  Adds docs/02-vta/rate-limiting.md and links it from the docs index,
  non-interactive setup and the setup example.



### Fixed

- **cli**: Type rate-limit refusals on the hand-rolled bootstrap and VTC paths ([#1521](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1521))

pnm bootstrap connect, cnm backup, and cnm audit verify build their own error strings from the HTTP status instead of going through the SDK client, so a 429 read as a bare "request failed" — the same class #1511 fixed for the SDK paths. Map 429 to VtaError::RateLimited via rate_limited_from_http (headers captured before the body), so print_cli_error names which service limited, the wait, and how to tune it. On pnm bootstrap connect the limiter runs before the carve-out is touched, so a note says the one-shot first boot is not spent and retry after the wait is safe. The header/attribution parsing is covered by vta-sdk's rate_limit tests; this is the call-site wiring.



## [0.16.7](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.16.6...pnm-cli-v0.16.7) — 2026-09-16


### Added

- **cli**: Name removal commands `delete`, and say what a delete leaves behind ([#1513](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1513))

* feat(cli): name removal commands `delete`, and say what a delete leaves behind

  Removal commands across pnm, cnm and the offline vta CLI are named
  `delete`. Each old name stays accepted as a hidden alias, so no script
  breaks:

  - `did-mgmt servers remove` -> `did-mgmt servers delete` (pnm + vta)
  - `pnm vta remove` -> `pnm vta delete`
  - `cnm community remove` -> `cnm community delete` (gains --yes/-y)
  - `pnm memory forget` -> `pnm memory delete`
  - `vta approvals disable` -> `vta approvals delete-all` (`disable` still
    works and prints a note naming the new command)

  Where a delete is not complete, the command now says what remains and
  how to remove it: `vta delete` / `community delete` keep the VTA's ACL
  entry (the notice prints the `acl delete <did>` that revokes it);
  `servers delete` lists DIDs still registered against the server, whose
  logs stay hosted there; `vault delete` / `cred-vault delete` without
  --force name `purge` / `--force`.



### Fixed

- **backup**: Typed refusals for backup on a DIDComm/TSP-only VTA ([#1516](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1516))

The descriptor flow (`pnm backup export|import`) is REST-only: its
  `stream` algorithm moves the bytes over the VTA's HTTPS blob endpoint.
  A DIDComm/TSP-only VTA could not be backed up remotely, and every layer
  reported that badly.

  - SDK: `post_trust_task` refused DIDComm/TSP clients with `Validation`
    ("your request is wrong") although the same request succeeds over
    REST. It now returns `VtaError::UnsupportedTransport` naming
    `--transport rest`, as do `download_blob`/`upload_blob` when a client
    has no REST leg (their 429 → `RateLimited` mapping is unchanged). A
    DIDComm client's `rest_url` is still not used: it can come from the
    caller rather than from an advertised `VTARest` service, and the flow
    must not downgrade past what the peer advertises.
  - Server: a VTA with no `public_url` answered `initiate-*` with an opaque
    `internalError`, after already staging the bundle. It now refuses up
    front with the code `vta/backup/initiate-{export,import}/1.0` declare,
    `<slug>:transportUnavailable`, and the client maps that to
    `UnsupportedTransport`.
  - CLI: `--use-rest-legacy` on a DIDComm client silently sent the whole
    envelope as one mediator message (refused above 1 MiB, seen as a
    timeout). It now warns with the size caveat and `--transport rest`.
    Import no longer uploads the bytes twice: the commit finalizes the
    previewed bundle (new `VtaClient::backup_finalize_import`), and
    re-uploads only when the slot was already collected (not-found). A
    conflict is surfaced rather than retried, because it may mean "already
    committed" and commit is not idempotent.
  - retry_safety: initiate-export's reply carries the secret
    `transportToken`, not complete-export's; the classifications were
    swapped to match (initiate-export → KeyedSecret, complete-export →
    Keyed) so the token is never cached in the dedup store.
  - Docs: stale status line, non-existent offline `vta backup` command,
    the appstate note's claim that blobs work for DIDComm clients, the SDK
    "works on every transport" claim, and an operator note on backup for a
    DIDComm/TSP-only VTA. The planned transfer algorithm is renamed
    `chunkedTrustTask` (SPEC §4.10 casing) and specified upstream in
    trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#474.



## [0.16.6](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.16.5...pnm-cli-v0.16.6) — 2026-09-16


## [0.16.5](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.16.4...pnm-cli-v0.16.5) — 2026-09-15


## [0.16.4](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.16.3...pnm-cli-v0.16.4) — 2026-09-14


### Added

- **pnm**: Confirm before `vta remove`, with a --force opt-out ([#1457](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1457))

`pnm vta remove <slug>` deleted the stored VTA connection and its
  keyring credential with no prompt, and a mistyped slug is unrecoverable
  from the config file. It now prints what is about to go — name, DID, the
  credential, and whether the default VTA moves — and asks before doing
  it.

  The prompt reuses `vta_cli_common::commands::contexts::confirm_destructive`,
  so the wording matches `pnm contexts delete`. As there, a non-TTY stdin
  reads EOF and aborts, which is what `--force` is for: scripts that today
  call `pnm vta remove` (the `pnm setup --overwrite` hint points at it) pass
  the flag to keep their old behaviour.



### Fixed

- **webvh**: Key records follow the document's verification-method ids, and a repair for the ones that don't ([#1466](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1466))

* fix(webvh): name a created DID's key records after the document it published

  A key record's id **is** a verification-method id. `save_entity_key_records`
  says so in its own name, and `vta_sdk::did_secrets::select_secret_kid` rule 1
  depends on it: the kid a mediator matches inbound JWE recipients against is the
  record id, on the reasoning that "the DID document decided what the key is
  called".

  Create never read the document to find out. It named the records `{did}#key-0`
  and `{did}#key-1` while the document was whatever the caller or the template
  said — and the `room` and `room-host` built-in templates number their methods
  from `#key-1`. So on every room and every room host this VTA has ever minted:

  - the document's `#key-1` is the **signing** key and the keystore's `#key-1` is
    the **x25519** one. One name, two keys, no error anywhere. Hand the id the
    document publishes to `keys/sign` — the natural thing to do, having read it
    off the document — and the oracle fetches an x25519 record for an EdDSA
    signature;
  - the document's `keyAgreement` (`#key-2`) matches no record at all, so an
    authcrypt message addressed to it finds no local secret. That is the storm.ws
    outage of #337 reached from the other side: there a decorative label
    overwrote the right kid, here the right kid was never stored;
  - `next_fragment_id` was stored as the constant 2, so the DID's first rotation
    allocates `#key-2` — over the id its key-agreement method is already
    published under.

  Room credentials still verify, which is why this stayed quiet: `RoomKeySigner`
  hardcodes `{room_did}#key-1` to match the template, and the public keys line up
  positionally, so the proof names a method that resolves to the key that signed
  it. Everything that addresses a key *by name* is what breaks.

  ## The fix reads the document rather than renumbering the templates

- **pnm-cli**: Anchor TEE bootstrap connect by DID and PCR0 ([#1454](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1454))

* fix(pnm-cli): anchor TEE bootstrap connect by DID and PCR0

  Add mutually exclusive --vta-did and --vta-url targets. Resolve WebVH locally without guessing a URL on failure, preserve the advertised REST endpoint, and reject credentials for a different VTA DID.

  Accept a pinned PCR0 as the online connect trust anchor without requiring the server-generated digest or an opt-out warning. Preserve explicit digest opt-out warnings, conflicting-flag errors, and mandatory offline digest verification.

  Add regression tests for target selection, strict endpoint resolution, credential identity checks, and anchor combinations. Update the PNM quick start and TEE bootstrap guide.



## [0.16.3](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.16.2...pnm-cli-v0.16.3) — 2026-09-12


## [0.16.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.16.1...pnm-cli-v0.16.2) — 2026-09-10


## [0.16.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.15.1...pnm-cli-v0.16.0) — 2026-09-09


### Fixed

- **rooms**: A presentation is bound to its presenter — and dtg-credentials 0.6 → 0.9.1 ([#1356](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1356))

* fix(rooms): bind a presentation to its presenter, not to the host

  `pnm-cli rooms --host-did …` could never work. Every request it made was
  refused as `WrongAudience`, and omitting the flag "worked" only by
  skipping the check it exists to perform — so the flag's two states were
  broken and unprotected.

  `audience` is not who a presentation is addressed to.
  `dtg_credentials::authority::verify_chain` compares it to the PRESENTER —
  "the leaf must be presentable by whoever is presenting it" — so it is
  holder binding, and its whole job is to make a captured presentation
  worthless to whoever captured it. Filled with the host's DID it named a
  party no presenter can ever match.

  The value to bind to was already named a few lines away: `RoomSigner`'s
  doc says "a room request is signed by the party the presentation was
  minted for". This passes exactly that. There is no unbound case left, so
  the warning about one goes, and `--host-did` keeps its real job of naming
  the document's recipient.

  ## The spec says otherwise, and that is filed separately

  `rooms/keys/present/0.1` describes `audience` as "the party the
  presentation is for … a host's identifier, normally". The CLI implemented
  the spec faithfully; the spec and the credential library it runs on
  disagree, identically in dtg-credentials 0.6 and 0.7, so it is not
  version drift.

  This changes the CLI to match the verifier rather than the prose, because
  a presentation that cannot verify protects nobody while being wrong in
  the other direction. Which side should move is a working-group question —
  0.7's own notes point at upstream PR #41, "a key-control demonstration at
  invocation, which removes `audience` as redundant" — and is raised there.

  * fix(rooms)!: stop sending `audience` and `nonce` on rooms/keys/present

  Completes the previous commit, which repointed `audience` at the presenter so
  it would at least verify. It should not be sent at all, and neither should
  `nonce`. Both are removed from `rooms/keys/present` by spec 0.2.

  `audience` named the party that had to PRESENT a credential, not the one it was
  addressed to — so a host DID named somebody no presenter can ever be, and the
  host refused every request. That is now moot: dtg-credentials 0.8.0 removed the
  property and made the real rule explicit, which the VTA was already satisfying.
  The leaf grants to the DID this VTA authenticated, and a host refuses a chain
  whose leaf grants to anyone else. Who may present is established, not declared.

  `nonce` was written into the presentation object, which is closed and has no
  member for it — so a caller supplying one got a presentation the host rejects
  as malformed. It could not have been made to work: every signature in a
  presentation is an ISSUER's, never the presenter's, so a challenge inside it is
  unauthenticated and a replay copies it along with everything else. Freshness is
  the request's, via `issuedAt` and the duplicate-execution rule keyed on
  document `id`.

  ## A second live instance, found while doing this

  `rooms/keys/backfill` passed the caller-named host as the audience in
  `vta-service`, exactly as that spec's normative MUST instructed. Every backfill
  this VTA attempted was refused for the same reason. What actually makes a
  caller-named host safe is that the leaf grants to the VTA: naming a host
  transfers no standing. It does hand that host sight of the principal's
  credentials, which is a disclosure rather than an escalation, and the comment
  now says so.

  ## Nothing binds a presentation to a host, deliberately

  A chain is scoped to the ROOM. One rooted in a room confers nothing anywhere
  else, and any host serving that room would honour it — a room may have more
  than one host, and moving between them without reissuing credentials is the
  point. Binding a request to its destination is `recipient` on the document that
  carries the presentation, per SPEC.md §4.8.2, which its proof covers.



## [0.15.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.15.0...pnm-cli-v0.15.1) — 2026-09-08


### Documentation

- **persona**: Say "attribute" on screen, not "fact" ([#1319](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1319))

`design-docs/persona-vocabulary.md` translated `attribute` to **fact** for
  everything a person reads. That was wrong in two independent ways.

  It asserts what the model cannot promise. What a holder keeps in the pool is
  self-asserted until a credential backs it, and a face exists so a person can
  choose what to show — an old value, a pinned version, a value overridden for one
  context, or a value that is simply not true. The step-up card said "Approve
  disclosing 1 fact" about exactly that.

  And the word was already spent: `fact` is the VTC ceremony engine's term for a
  *verified* policy input (`vtc-service/src/ceremony/facts.rs`, `Facts` assembly,
  every `.rego`) — very nearly the opposite meaning, in the same product.

  `detail` is the persona audit envelope's own field, `trait` is a keyword,
  `entry` names an entry in a face and `value` is the field inside an attribute,
  so the spec word comes to the screen instead and that row stops translating.
  Truth is carried by the provenance beneath the value, never by the noun.

  - step-up approval card: "1 fact" → "1 attribute" (the string an approver reads
    on their phone)
  - `pnm persona …` help text and `vta-cli-common` printed output: "Your facts:"
    → "Your attributes:", "Fact:" → "Attribute:", and the surrounding guidance
  - `vta-persona` doc comments that define the model in the old word

  Commands, flags, task URIs and wire records are untouched — they always said
  `attribute`. Nothing in `vtc-service/src/ceremony/` is touched; that `Facts` is
  the other meaning.

  vta-persona 88 tests and vta-service persona_trust_task 23 tests pass.



## [0.15.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.14.6...pnm-cli-v0.15.0) — 2026-09-07


### Added

- **rooms**: A member's CLI surface, driven through the oracle ([#1285](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1285))

Rooms had no CLI. Using one meant writing Rust against `vtc-client` or hand-
  building signed Trust Task documents, which is not a surface an operator has.
  `pnm rooms {create,list,get,put,curate,renew}` is that surface for a member.

  ## Two parties, never confused

  Every command talks to both and keeps them apart: the operator's **VTA** mints
  a presentation (`rooms/keys/present`) and opens sealed records
  (`rooms/keys/open`), and the room's **host** stores the bytes. The credentials
  the presentation is derived from and the group key that opens a record stay
  inside the VTA - this CLI holds neither at any point.

  That makes the CLI the oracle's first real consumer, and it works: a member
  who holds less than an action needs is refused by their own VTA, before
  anything reaches the host, which is the earlier and clearer of the two
  refusals.

  Each command mints its own presentation for exactly the action it performs -
  `read` for list/get, `write` for put, `curate` for curate, `admin` for renew.
  Caching one across commands would mean re-binding it (impossible without the
  VTA) or sending it unbound, which is a bearer token.

  ## Where the pieces had to live

  `vta-sdk` gains `room_present` / `room_open`, because those are calls to your
  own VTA. It cannot gain the room *wire types*: `vti-common` re-exports
  `vta_sdk::acl`, so `vta-sdk -> vti-rooms -> vti-common -> vta-sdk` is a cycle.
  So `vta-cli-common` takes `vtc-client`, which despite its name is the
  host-neutral room client - `room-host`'s own example drives itself with it. A
  second copy of the `rooms/*` wire types in the CLI is exactly the duplication
  that crate deleted.

  `vtc-client` gains `curate_record`, which nothing had implemented.

  ## What it deliberately cannot do

  **Write to a sealed room**: sealing needs the room's group key, and no task
  seals on a caller's behalf. **Issue credentials**: minting a VIC, VMC or VAC
  needs the room's own signing key, which is the owner's - a different party with
  different custody. Both are refused with the reason rather than half-served,
  and `get` translates the epoch-mismatch failure into "a commit has not been
  delivered", which is what it means and not what it reads like.

  Five tests on the two pure decisions: rebuilding a session from what the VTA
  minted (each missing member refused rather than defaulted, a subject binding
  surviving, a non-string chain link refused rather than silently shortening the
  chain), and the pin/unpin tri-state where absence must stay distinct from
  false.

- **acl**: Create an entry already narrowed, rather than narrowing it after ([#1280](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1280))

#1279 left `acl/grant` refusing a capability narrowing and pointing at
  `acl update`, because taking one meant a fifteenth positional parameter on
  `create_acl`. Refusing was honest but it leaves a real window: between the
  grant and the narrowing the entry holds everything its role implies, and a
  subject that authenticates inside that window is authorized by what it found
  there.

  `create_acl` now takes a `CreateAclParams` struct - the shape `update_acl`
  already had - so the narrowing is one more named field rather than a
  fourteenth argument nobody can read at the call site. Test call sites state
  the two or three members they care about and default the rest instead of
  spelling every one to reach the last.

  The rule is the update path's, applied where the entry is born: a name the
  role does not carry is refused rather than dropped, an unknown name is
  refused, and neither leaves a row behind. `pnm acl create --capabilities
  memory-read,room-present` is now the form to prefer, and the agent runbook
  says so.

  Also echoes the stored narrowing from `acl create` and `acl show`, so the
  restriction can be read back from wherever it was set.

- **acl**: Enforce an entry's capabilities, and give an operator a way to set them ([#1279](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1279))

### Added

- **persona**: The operator surface, and a preview built to be read ([#1257](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1257))

* feat(persona): SDK wire types and client methods for the persona family

  Twenty-four request bodies under `protocols::persona` and the client
  methods that dispatch them, against the specs merged in
  trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#360.

  Responses come back as `Value`, as they do for `app-state`: these are the
  shapes a caller must get right to be understood, and a response is read
  by whatever renders it.

  **Hand-written here, generated in the service.** `vta-service` builds
  these payloads from `trust-tasks-rs` directly, because a mirror is a
  second definition of one contract and free to drift. This crate cannot do
  the same: `trust-tasks-rs` is an optional dependency here and the `client`
  feature does not enable it, so a types-only consumer must not be made to
  pull the generated tree in. Two source-level censuses cover the gap —
  `payload_ext_census` and `payload_null_census`.

  **The boundary is in the types.** `LocalProfileEntry` is a separate type
  from `ProfileEntry` rather than the same type with variants unused,
  because the published schema for `persona/local/profile/put/1.0` closes
  its entries to a single `inline` member. A profile built inside a trust
  context has nowhere to name an attribute in the agent-scoped pool. That
  closure is load-bearing rather than incidental, which is why it is
  mirrored as a distinct type instead of a shared one used carefully.

  **Three census exemptions, and why they are not the easy way out.**
  `OverrideValue`, `InlineValue` and `LocalProfileEntry` deny unknown fields
  and carry no `ext`, which `payload_ext_census` flags. Adding one would be
  wrong: the published schemas close all three with
  `additionalProperties: false` and declare no `ext` slot, and
  `trust-tasks-rs` generates them with `deny_unknown_fields` and no `ext`
  for the same reason — so the field would make this crate emit documents
  the VTA's own `validate_payload` rejects. They join
  `IssuedCredentialSummary` in `NO_EXT_BY_DESIGN`, which exists for exactly
  this case: a member of a payload rather than a payload.

  `ProfileEntry` carries `untagged` **and** `deny_unknown_fields`, with the
  variants in reading order, for the reason recorded on the store-side type:
  the clause is the only thing keeping the four forms apart, so a test can
  prove it is working.

- **pnm-cli**: Add memory command group ([#1222](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1222))

* feat(pnm-cli): add memory command group

  Add `pnm memory` for CRUD over the VTA's per-context agent memory
  (`spec/vta/memory/{put,list,delete}/0.1`): plant, recall, forget, wipe.
  Context-scoped via `--context` (default `default`); `--json` supported.

### Fixed

- **sdk**: Give every authenticated client its identity, and adopt provision/integration 0.3 ([#1147](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1147))

#1146 made every producer sign, and left seven production paths building
  clients that cannot. Each authenticates, takes the token, and drops the DID and
  key on the floor — so every task they dispatch is refused for a missing
  `recipient` and `proof`. `SessionStore::connect` was fixed; nothing else was,
  because no test drives those paths against an enforcing VTA.

- **vta**: Re-case the extended error codes the Trust Tasks registry moved ([#1122](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1122))

* fix(vta)!: emit the re-cased extended error codes the registry now declares

  trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#279 re-cased 200 extended error-code local
  parts to lowerCamelCase per SPEC §4.10 rule 4 — only the part after the `:`
  moved, the namespace is unchanged. This service still produced the snake_case
  spellings for 32 of them, so every one of those rejects carried a code the
  registry no longer defines and no conforming consumer can branch on.

  Every site here is an **emitter**: this repo decides what to send, and the
  registry decides what is correct to send, so each moves to the new spelling
  with no compatibility arm. The matcher side — where this repo reads a code a
  peer produced and cannot control that peer's deploy order — is handled
  separately in the following commit.

  Three of the vault emitters build their namespace by interpolation
  (`vault/{verb}:not_found`, `vault/{verb}:version_conflict`,
  `vault/{op}:not_found` in `vault_not_found`, `check_expected_version` and
  `refuse_if_not_active`), so the codes they produce do not appear as literals
  anywhere. Those helpers cover `vault/delete:{notFound,versionConflict}` and the
  `notFound` conflation the three consumer-facing use paths rely on for
  enumeration resistance.



### Chore

- **sdk**: Release vta-sdk 0.30.0 for the added CreateKeyBody field ([#1156](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1156))

`CreateKeyBody` gained a `key_id` field while the crate stayed at 0.29.0.
  The struct is exhaustively constructible through the public API, so an
  existing literal no longer compiles — a breaking change under 0.x rules,
  which the semver report has been flagging as its one real finding
  (195 pass, 1 fail) since the field landed.

  Bumps the crate and the nineteen intra-workspace requirements that pin it,
  so `cargo check --workspace` still resolves the path copy and a consumer
  resolving from the registry gets a version that admits the break.

### Fixed

- **sdk/cli**: A credential store that cannot be opened must not read as "never logged in" ([#1032](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1032))

All four binaries treated an unavailable OS credential store as a warning
  and carried on. What happened next was worse than a silent fallback:
  `KeyringBackend` stayed registered, every `Entry::new` returned
  `NoDefaultStore`, and `SessionBackend::load` swallowed it and returned
  `None` — so the tool behaved exactly as though the user had never logged
  in. A silent fallback at least stores something; this silently forgets.
  OpenVTC hit the user-facing end of it: a profile kept in the Linux kernel
  keyring did not survive a reboot, and the error told the user to check
  their network.

  The four call sites are byte-identical, but their consequences are not,
  so the fix is not:

  - `pnm` and `cnm` keep their session — the admin DID and its private key
    — in the credential store and nowhere else. They now exit at startup
    via `keyring_init::install_default_store_or_exit`, which is the whole
    point: there is nothing they can usefully do next.
  - `vta` and `vtc` never construct an SDK `SessionStore`; they use the
    fjall-backed `KeyspaceSessionStore`, and their keyring use is the seed
    store, one of eight `[secrets] backend` options. Which one is in play
    is not known until config loads, long after `main` starts, so hard
    failing there would break every deployment on aws/gcp/azure/vault/k8s
    running on a host with no credential store — the normal server shape.
    They get `warn_store_unavailable`, and `KeyringSeedStore` — which
    already failed closed — now says which subsystem broke rather than
    "failed to create keyring entry".

  The second half is `FileBackend`. `default_backend` ended in an
  `#[allow(unreachable_code)]` fallback into it whenever no backend feature
  was enabled, writing the admin private key to `sessions.json` as
  plaintext at the process umask, announced by a WARNING on every access —
  which is to say, invisible. `pnm`'s own bootstrap-secrets path has always
  used 0600; the inconsistency was inside one tool.

  That fallback is gone. A build with no session store gets `RefusingBackend`,
  which refuses to save rather than inventing somewhere to put a private
  key. `FileBackend` is now reachable only by explicit choice — the
  `config-session` feature, or `VTI_SECURE_STORE=file` at runtime — and
  creates its file at 0600 inside a 0700 directory *before* writing, since
  writing and then hardening leaves a window at the umask. An existing
  world-readable file from an older build is re-hardened on the next write.

  The runtime override exists because requiring a rebuild to run on a
  headless host creates pressure to disable the check rather than make a
  choice. It parses strictly: `os` or `file`, and anything else — including
  a near-miss like `plaintext` — resolves to neither and refuses. Asking
  for `os` on a build with no `keyring` feature refuses too, rather than
  quietly substituting a file.

  One explanation now serves every tool, in `vta_sdk::secure_store`, taking
  the error as `Display` so it is available without the `keyring` feature —
  OpenVTC renders the same text and honours the same override, which was
  the stated goal: identical secret handling across vta, pnm, openvtc and
  vtc, hard failure rather than a fallback to open text files.



## [0.12.8](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.12.7...pnm-cli-v0.12.8) — 2026-08-20


### Documentation

- **pnm-cli**: Document the tsp and azure-secrets build features ([#1016](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1016))

The README's Feature Flags table listed two of the crate's four features.
  Both omissions changed what an operator ends up with:

  `tsp` is a default (`default = ["keyring", "tsp"]`) and gates the round-trip
  TSP probe in `pnm health`. The keyring-free build the README recommended,
  `--no-default-features --features config-session`, silently dropped it, after
  which `pnm health` reports an advertised TSPTransport service without ever
  exercising it. The build examples now re-add `tsp` and say why.

  `azure-secrets` is off by default and inert unless `keyring` is also off --
  the backend's Azure arm is gated `not(feature = "keyring")` -- so adding it to
  a default build selects nothing and reports no error.

  The section also claimed "at least one of keyring or config-session must be
  enabled". Nothing enforces that. With neither, the backend falls through to
  the plaintext file store and warns on every access, which is a materially
  different guarantee from the build-time gate the sentence implied. Replaced
  with the real selection order, keyring -> azure-secrets -> config-session ->
  plaintext fallback, and the warning verbatim.

### Added

- **vta-keys**: Add non-extractable internal signing keys ([#995](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/995))

An ordinary VTA key is BIP-32 derived, so anyone holding the 24-word mnemonic
  can reconstruct it offline. That is what makes the VTA recoverable, and equally
  what makes "the operator cannot obtain this key" false — the second limb of what
  eIDAS calls sole control.

  An internal key is generated from the system CSPRNG, has no derivation path, and
  is never returned by any surface. The VTA acts only as a signing oracle for it.

  Deliberately not a flag on the imported-key path. That path wraps its secrets
  under a KEK derived from the master seed (derive_kek(seed, salt)), so a
  non-extractable flag on it would be decorative: the boundary it claims to
  enforce has already been walked around. Internal keys get their own keyspace,
  INTERNAL_KEYS, with no seed involvement at any point, and that keyspace is in
  EXCLUDED_FROM_BACKUP by design — a backup carrying it would be an export of keys
  the VTA promises never to export, and restoring it elsewhere would clone a
  signer.

  Refused for did:webvh log entries, enforced in code rather than left to
  guidance. WebVH is append-only and each entry is authorised by the update key
  the previous entry named; an unrecoverable update key means that if storage is
  lost the DID can never be updated again by anyone, permanently, and every
  integration pinned to it is stranded. Credentials can be re-issued, an
  append-only identity log cannot. Internal keys remain fine as a signing
  verificationMethod inside a published document, where loss costs the ability to
  produce new signatures rather than control of the identity.

  The export refusal is not a permission check — admin is not a bypass, because
  the value of the origin is that no caller holds this power. There are two
  refusals (an early return and an in-match arm); removing either leaves the other,
  and removing both does not compile, since the match over KeyOrigin becomes
  non-exhaustive. An export path cannot silently reopen.

  Operator surfaces carry the cost prominently: `pnm keys create --internal`
  prints what is lost and requires the operator to type a confirmation phrase
  rather than mash y, the response repeats the warning, and docs/02-vta/
  internal-keys.md covers when to use one, what actually protects it (enclave
  measurement + KMS, not a mnemonic), and the two things that genuinely destroy
  it.

### Added

- **webvh**: Find DIDs a host serves that this VTA has no record of ([#976](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/976))

A DID can exist on a hosting server and nowhere in the VTA that owns it. The
  delete path says so out loud: `delete_did_webvh` calls the host first and, when
  that call fails, logs "continuing local cleanup but DID is now orphaned on the
  daemon" and removes the local record anyway. The host keeps serving a DID whose
  controller has discarded its keys, and nothing since then could tell you.

  Found the hard way: the hosting UI listed a DID, a delegated edit against it was
  refused with `did not found: SCID … not found`, and from the outside that reads
  as lost keys rather than an orphan.

      pnm did-mgmt dids reconcile --server primary

  Read-only, and repairs nothing on purpose — a host-only entry wants removing at
  the host, a local-only entry wants its publish retrying, and neither is safe to
  infer from a list. Naming them is the job.

  **Only the VTA can answer it.** The operator holds no credentials for the
  hosting server; the host has no view of the VTA's records. So the VTA
  authenticates with its own credentials, reads `GET /api/dids?owner=<its own
  DID>`, and compares against its local records.

  Three decisions worth the reviewer's attention:

  - **`owner` is always sent**, though the endpoint allows omitting it. A VTA that
    administers its own host *is* an admin caller, and the host answers an admin
    who names no owner with every DID on the server — reporting every other
    tenant's DID as missing locally.
  - **Matched on the host's slot id, not the DID.** A slot reserved but never
    published to has no DID at all and is exactly as orphaned as one that was.
    Pinned by a test.
  - **Super-admin, and DIDComm-only registrations are refused.** The host has no
    notion of VTA contexts, so its listing cannot be filtered by
    `has_context_access` the way `dids list` filters local records — and scoping
    the *result* instead would hide orphans from everyone, since an orphan has no
    local record to carry a context. The host's listing is REST-only, so against a
    DIDComm-only server this errors rather than returning an empty diff: "nothing
    to report" is the one wrong answer available, because it is the answer an
    operator stops looking after.

  ## The registry cost, stated plainly

  This adds one URI — `vta/webvh/servers/dids/0.1` — that the published registry
  has no spec for, so it lands on **both** drift registers: the per-family census
  in `vtc-service` (spec/vta 36 → 37) and the per-URI
  `UNSPECCED_DISPATCHED_URIS` in this crate, whose own rule reads "author the spec
  upstream — growing the allowlist is the wrong fix".

  It is added knowingly. The spec cannot come first from inside this repo: it
  needs a PR to trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf and a `trust-tasks-rs` release
  before the URI resolves, which is how every entry on that list arrived. The
  disposition is **spec under `vta/`**, recorded in `registry-drift-triage.md`
  beside `servers/{list,register,remove}` and for the same reason: the subject is
  the VTA's own view of a host it uses, and `did-management/did/list/0.1` is the
  host's listing rather than the comparison against local records. The nearest
  sibling shows the way out — `servers/domains/0.1` relays the same host's domain
  view, went upstream as dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#171, and is on neither list as a
  result.

  The alternatives were weighed and are worse: a REST-only route is unreachable
  from a TSP-transport CLI, and folding this onto `webvh/dids/list/1.0` makes a
  local read do network I/O and grows a response shape most callers never want.

  The `did-hosting-ui` half — the warning beside the delegated-edit button, and
  the hint that names this command when the agent answers "not found" — is
  affinidi/affinidi-webvh-service#163.

### Fixed

- **provisioning**: Relay the holder's bootstrap VP as raw JSON ([#949](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/949))

A relayer is usually not the holder — the air-gap onboarding flow exists
  precisely so it isn't — so `pnm bootstrap provision-integration` forwards
  a document some other process signed. It parsed that document into a
  typed `BootstrapRequest` and let serde re-render it on the way out, so
  the maintainer verified bytes the holder never signed. Both transports,
  every relayed request.

  Same defect as #946 one layer up, and with the same trigger: #917 moved
  `ask.type` to the 0.2 camelCase tag, so a holder on vta-sdk < 0.21.11
  (did-hosting `VTI-Cypress-RC-1` among them) has its own valid signature
  rewritten in transit and rejected as a forgery at the far end. #946 fixed
  the two maintainer-side surfaces that re-serialised; this is the client
  side of the same rule, and the two together close the flow.

  `ProvisionIntegrationRequest.request` and `provision_integration_didcomm`
  now take `serde_json::Value`. **Breaking** for anything constructing that
  struct. Callers that signed the VP themselves — every SDK runner — go
  through the new `BootstrapRequest::to_signed_wire_value`, where serde
  output and signed bytes are the same document by construction; pnm keeps
  a typed view purely to read `contextHint` and relays the raw JSON.

  `provision_integration_didcomm`'s doc comment already promised the VP was
  "left byte-identical either way". It now is.

  The existing relay tests could not have caught this: they assert the body
  carries `serde_json::to_value(&vp)`, which is the SDK's rendering
  compared against itself and true however badly the relayer mangles a
  foreign document. The new test starts from a VP this crate did not
  render, relays it under both spec versions, and requires it to arrive
  byte-for-byte and still verify. It also asserts the fixture actually
  diverges from this crate's serde output, so it fails loudly rather than
  going quietly vacuous if the casings ever converge.
