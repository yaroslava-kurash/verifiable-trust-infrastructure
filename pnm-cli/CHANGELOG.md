### Fixed

- **sdk**: Give every authenticated client its identity, and adopt provision/integration 0.3 ([#1147](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1147))

#1146 made every producer sign, and left seven production paths building
  clients that cannot. Each authenticates, takes the token, and drops the DID and
  key on the floor — so every task they dispatch is refused for a missing
  `recipient` and `proof`. `SessionStore::connect` was fixed; nothing else was,
  because no test drives those paths against an enforcing VTA.

- **vta**: Re-case the extended error codes the Trust Tasks registry moved ([#1122](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1122))

* fix(vta)!: emit the re-cased extended error codes the registry now declares

  trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#279 re-cased 200 extended error-code local
  parts to lowerCamelCase per SPEC §4.10 rule 4 — only the part after the `:`
  moved, the namespace is unchanged. This service still produced the snake_case
  spellings for 32 of them, so every one of those rejects carried a code the
  registry no longer defines and no conforming consumer can branch on.

  Every site here is an **emitter**: this repo decides what to send, and the
  registry decides what is correct to send, so each moves to the new spelling
  with no compatibility arm. The matcher side — where this repo reads a code a
  peer produced and cannot control that peer's deploy order — is handled
  separately in the following commit.

  Three of the vault emitters build their namespace by interpolation
  (`vault/{verb}:not_found`, `vault/{verb}:version_conflict`,
  `vault/{op}:not_found` in `vault_not_found`, `check_expected_version` and
  `refuse_if_not_active`), so the codes they produce do not appear as literals
  anywhere. Those helpers cover `vault/delete:{notFound,versionConflict}` and the
  `notFound` conflation the three consumer-facing use paths rely on for
  enumeration resistance.



### Chore

- **sdk**: Release vta-sdk 0.30.0 for the added CreateKeyBody field ([#1156](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1156))

`CreateKeyBody` gained a `key_id` field while the crate stayed at 0.29.0.
  The struct is exhaustively constructible through the public API, so an
  existing literal no longer compiles — a breaking change under 0.x rules,
  which the semver report has been flagging as its one real finding
  (195 pass, 1 fail) since the field landed.

  Bumps the crate and the nineteen intra-workspace requirements that pin it,
  so `cargo check --workspace` still resolves the path copy and a consumer
  resolving from the registry gets a version that admits the break.



## [0.13.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.13.1...pnm-cli-v0.13.2) — 2026-08-26


## [0.13.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.13.0...pnm-cli-v0.13.1) — 2026-08-22


## [0.13.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.12.8...pnm-cli-v0.13.0) — 2026-08-21


### Fixed

- **sdk/cli**: A credential store that cannot be opened must not read as "never logged in" ([#1032](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1032))

All four binaries treated an unavailable OS credential store as a warning
  and carried on. What happened next was worse than a silent fallback:
  `KeyringBackend` stayed registered, every `Entry::new` returned
  `NoDefaultStore`, and `SessionBackend::load` swallowed it and returned
  `None` — so the tool behaved exactly as though the user had never logged
  in. A silent fallback at least stores something; this silently forgets.
  OpenVTC hit the user-facing end of it: a profile kept in the Linux kernel
  keyring did not survive a reboot, and the error told the user to check
  their network.

  The four call sites are byte-identical, but their consequences are not,
  so the fix is not:

  - `pnm` and `cnm` keep their session — the admin DID and its private key
    — in the credential store and nowhere else. They now exit at startup
    via `keyring_init::install_default_store_or_exit`, which is the whole
    point: there is nothing they can usefully do next.
  - `vta` and `vtc` never construct an SDK `SessionStore`; they use the
    fjall-backed `KeyspaceSessionStore`, and their keyring use is the seed
    store, one of eight `[secrets] backend` options. Which one is in play
    is not known until config loads, long after `main` starts, so hard
    failing there would break every deployment on aws/gcp/azure/vault/k8s
    running on a host with no credential store — the normal server shape.
    They get `warn_store_unavailable`, and `KeyringSeedStore` — which
    already failed closed — now says which subsystem broke rather than
    "failed to create keyring entry".

  The second half is `FileBackend`. `default_backend` ended in an
  `#[allow(unreachable_code)]` fallback into it whenever no backend feature
  was enabled, writing the admin private key to `sessions.json` as
  plaintext at the process umask, announced by a WARNING on every access —
  which is to say, invisible. `pnm`'s own bootstrap-secrets path has always
  used 0600; the inconsistency was inside one tool.

  That fallback is gone. A build with no session store gets `RefusingBackend`,
  which refuses to save rather than inventing somewhere to put a private
  key. `FileBackend` is now reachable only by explicit choice — the
  `config-session` feature, or `VTI_SECURE_STORE=file` at runtime — and
  creates its file at 0600 inside a 0700 directory *before* writing, since
  writing and then hardening leaves a window at the umask. An existing
  world-readable file from an older build is re-hardened on the next write.

  The runtime override exists because requiring a rebuild to run on a
  headless host creates pressure to disable the check rather than make a
  choice. It parses strictly: `os` or `file`, and anything else — including
  a near-miss like `plaintext` — resolves to neither and refuses. Asking
  for `os` on a build with no `keyring` feature refuses too, rather than
  quietly substituting a file.

  One explanation now serves every tool, in `vta_sdk::secure_store`, taking
  the error as `Display` so it is available without the `keyring` feature —
  OpenVTC renders the same text and honours the same override, which was
  the stated goal: identical secret handling across vta, pnm, openvtc and
  vtc, hard failure rather than a fallback to open text files.



## [0.12.8](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.12.7...pnm-cli-v0.12.8) — 2026-08-20


### Documentation

- **pnm-cli**: Document the tsp and azure-secrets build features ([#1016](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1016))

The README's Feature Flags table listed two of the crate's four features.
  Both omissions changed what an operator ends up with:

  `tsp` is a default (`default = ["keyring", "tsp"]`) and gates the round-trip
  TSP probe in `pnm health`. The keyring-free build the README recommended,
  `--no-default-features --features config-session`, silently dropped it, after
  which `pnm health` reports an advertised TSPTransport service without ever
  exercising it. The build examples now re-add `tsp` and say why.

  `azure-secrets` is off by default and inert unless `keyring` is also off --
  the backend's Azure arm is gated `not(feature = "keyring")` -- so adding it to
  a default build selects nothing and reports no error.

  The section also claimed "at least one of keyring or config-session must be
  enabled". Nothing enforces that. With neither, the backend falls through to
  the plaintext file store and warns on every access, which is a materially
  different guarantee from the build-time gate the sentence implied. Replaced
  with the real selection order, keyring -> azure-secrets -> config-session ->
  plaintext fallback, and the warning verbatim.



## [0.12.7](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.12.6...pnm-cli-v0.12.7) — 2026-08-18


## [0.12.6](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.12.5...pnm-cli-v0.12.6) — 2026-08-17


### Added

- **vta-keys**: Add non-extractable internal signing keys ([#995](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/995))

An ordinary VTA key is BIP-32 derived, so anyone holding the 24-word mnemonic
  can reconstruct it offline. That is what makes the VTA recoverable, and equally
  what makes "the operator cannot obtain this key" false — the second limb of what
  eIDAS calls sole control.

  An internal key is generated from the system CSPRNG, has no derivation path, and
  is never returned by any surface. The VTA acts only as a signing oracle for it.

  Deliberately not a flag on the imported-key path. That path wraps its secrets
  under a KEK derived from the master seed (derive_kek(seed, salt)), so a
  non-extractable flag on it would be decorative: the boundary it claims to
  enforce has already been walked around. Internal keys get their own keyspace,
  INTERNAL_KEYS, with no seed involvement at any point, and that keyspace is in
  EXCLUDED_FROM_BACKUP by design — a backup carrying it would be an export of keys
  the VTA promises never to export, and restoring it elsewhere would clone a
  signer.

  Refused for did:webvh log entries, enforced in code rather than left to
  guidance. WebVH is append-only and each entry is authorised by the update key
  the previous entry named; an unrecoverable update key means that if storage is
  lost the DID can never be updated again by anyone, permanently, and every
  integration pinned to it is stranded. Credentials can be re-issued, an
  append-only identity log cannot. Internal keys remain fine as a signing
  verificationMethod inside a published document, where loss costs the ability to
  produce new signatures rather than control of the identity.

  The export refusal is not a permission check — admin is not a bypass, because
  the value of the origin is that no caller holds this power. There are two
  refusals (an early return and an in-match arm); removing either leaves the other,
  and removing both does not compile, since the match over KeyOrigin becomes
  non-exhaustive. An export path cannot silently reopen.

  Operator surfaces carry the cost prominently: `pnm keys create --internal`
  prints what is lost and requires the operator to type a confirmation phrase
  rather than mash y, the response repeats the warning, and docs/02-vta/
  internal-keys.md covers when to use one, what actually protects it (enclave
  measurement + KMS, not a mnemonic), and the two things that genuinely destroy
  it.



## [0.12.5](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.12.4...pnm-cli-v0.12.5) — 2026-08-16

## [0.12.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.12.1...pnm-cli-v0.12.2) — 2026-08-14


### Added

- **webvh**: Find DIDs a host serves that this VTA has no record of ([#976](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/976))

A DID can exist on a hosting server and nowhere in the VTA that owns it. The
  delete path says so out loud: `delete_did_webvh` calls the host first and, when
  that call fails, logs "continuing local cleanup but DID is now orphaned on the
  daemon" and removes the local record anyway. The host keeps serving a DID whose
  controller has discarded its keys, and nothing since then could tell you.

  Found the hard way: the hosting UI listed a DID, a delegated edit against it was
  refused with `did not found: SCID … not found`, and from the outside that reads
  as lost keys rather than an orphan.

      pnm did-mgmt dids reconcile --server primary

  Read-only, and repairs nothing on purpose — a host-only entry wants removing at
  the host, a local-only entry wants its publish retrying, and neither is safe to
  infer from a list. Naming them is the job.

  **Only the VTA can answer it.** The operator holds no credentials for the
  hosting server; the host has no view of the VTA's records. So the VTA
  authenticates with its own credentials, reads `GET /api/dids?owner=<its own
  DID>`, and compares against its local records.

  Three decisions worth the reviewer's attention:

  - **`owner` is always sent**, though the endpoint allows omitting it. A VTA that
    administers its own host *is* an admin caller, and the host answers an admin
    who names no owner with every DID on the server — reporting every other
    tenant's DID as missing locally.
  - **Matched on the host's slot id, not the DID.** A slot reserved but never
    published to has no DID at all and is exactly as orphaned as one that was.
    Pinned by a test.
  - **Super-admin, and DIDComm-only registrations are refused.** The host has no
    notion of VTA contexts, so its listing cannot be filtered by
    `has_context_access` the way `dids list` filters local records — and scoping
    the *result* instead would hide orphans from everyone, since an orphan has no
    local record to carry a context. The host's listing is REST-only, so against a
    DIDComm-only server this errors rather than returning an empty diff: "nothing
    to report" is the one wrong answer available, because it is the answer an
    operator stops looking after.

  ## The registry cost, stated plainly

  This adds one URI — `vta/webvh/servers/dids/0.1` — that the published registry
  has no spec for, so it lands on **both** drift registers: the per-family census
  in `vtc-service` (spec/vta 36 → 37) and the per-URI
  `UNSPECCED_DISPATCHED_URIS` in this crate, whose own rule reads "author the spec
  upstream — growing the allowlist is the wrong fix".

  It is added knowingly. The spec cannot come first from inside this repo: it
  needs a PR to trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf and a `trust-tasks-rs` release
  before the URI resolves, which is how every entry on that list arrived. The
  disposition is **spec under `vta/`**, recorded in `registry-drift-triage.md`
  beside `servers/{list,register,remove}` and for the same reason: the subject is
  the VTA's own view of a host it uses, and `did-management/did/list/0.1` is the
  host's listing rather than the comparison against local records. The nearest
  sibling shows the way out — `servers/domains/0.1` relays the same host's domain
  view, went upstream as dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#171, and is on neither list as a
  result.

  The alternatives were weighed and are worse: a REST-only route is unreachable
  from a TSP-transport CLI, and folding this onto `webvh/dids/list/1.0` makes a
  local read do network I/O and grows a response shape most callers never want.

  The `did-hosting-ui` half — the warning beside the delegated-edit button, and
  the hint that names this command when the agent answers "not found" — is
  affinidi/affinidi-webvh-service#163.



## [0.12.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.12.0...pnm-cli-v0.12.1) — 2026-08-12


## [0.12.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.11.22...pnm-cli-v0.12.0) — 2026-08-12


### Fixed

- **provisioning**: Relay the holder's bootstrap VP as raw JSON ([#949](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/949))

A relayer is usually not the holder — the air-gap onboarding flow exists
  precisely so it isn't — so `pnm bootstrap provision-integration` forwards
  a document some other process signed. It parsed that document into a
  typed `BootstrapRequest` and let serde re-render it on the way out, so
  the maintainer verified bytes the holder never signed. Both transports,
  every relayed request.

  Same defect as #946 one layer up, and with the same trigger: #917 moved
  `ask.type` to the 0.2 camelCase tag, so a holder on vta-sdk < 0.21.11
  (did-hosting `VTI-Cypress-RC-1` among them) has its own valid signature
  rewritten in transit and rejected as a forgery at the far end. #946 fixed
  the two maintainer-side surfaces that re-serialised; this is the client
  side of the same rule, and the two together close the flow.

  `ProvisionIntegrationRequest.request` and `provision_integration_didcomm`
  now take `serde_json::Value`. **Breaking** for anything constructing that
  struct. Callers that signed the VP themselves — every SDK runner — go
  through the new `BootstrapRequest::to_signed_wire_value`, where serde
  output and signed bytes are the same document by construction; pnm keeps
  a typed view purely to read `contextHint` and relays the raw JSON.

  `provision_integration_didcomm`'s doc comment already promised the VP was
  "left byte-identical either way". It now is.

  The existing relay tests could not have caught this: they assert the body
  carries `serde_json::to_value(&vp)`, which is the SDK's rendering
  compared against itself and true however badly the relayer mangles a
  foreign document. The new test starts from a VP this crate did not
  render, relays it under both spec versions, and requires it to arrive
  byte-for-byte and still verify. It also asserts the fixture actually
  diverges from this crate's serde output, so it fails loudly rather than
  going quietly vacuous if the casings ever converge.



## [0.11.22](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.11.21...pnm-cli-v0.11.22) — 2026-08-12
