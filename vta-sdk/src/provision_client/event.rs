//! Channel protocol — events emitted by the runners and consumed by the
//! caller's UI / driver.
//!
//! Both [`VtaEvent`] and [`AttemptResultKind`] are part of the SDK's
//! versioned public surface. Variants are **stable** — adding a new
//! variant is the only permitted change. Renaming, removing, or
//! reshaping a variant is a breaking change. Consumers should match
//! exhaustively and treat unknown variants as forward-compat noise once
//! the channel grows past v1.
//!
//! See also [`super::diagnostics::DiagCheck`] / [`DiagStatus`], which
//! ride the `CheckStart` / `CheckDone` events.
