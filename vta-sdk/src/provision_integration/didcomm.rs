//! DIDComm transport for `provision-integration`.
//!
//! Holder side. Sends a VP-framed [`super::BootstrapRequest`] over an
//! authcrypt'd DIDComm session and receives the sealed
//! `TemplateBootstrap` bundle in the reply. Wire shapes are
//! transport-neutral — the payload that arrives is the same armored
//! bundle the REST endpoint returns.
//!
//! Use this when the holder already has a DIDComm session open to the
//! VTA (e.g., the integration's setup wizard). For file-based offline
//! bootstrap, use the `vta bootstrap provision-integration` CLI on the
//! VTA host.
//!
//! Auth model — layered like an onion. The DIDComm authcrypt
//! sender authenticates the *relayer* and is gated by the VTA's
//! ACL (sender must be admin in the target context). Inside the
//! body, the VP's `DataIntegrityProof` authenticates the *holder*
//! — the bundle is HPKE-sealed to the holder's X25519 derivation,
//! so only the holder can open it. Sender and holder may legitimately
//! differ; the air-gap onboarding flow relies on this:
//!
//!   1. Third-party integration (air-gapped) signs a BootstrapRequest
//!      with its own ephemeral did:key.
//!   2. Request is transferred to the operator's host.
//!   3. Operator's PNM relays the request over its DIDComm session.
//!   4. VTA issues the bundle, sealed to the integration.
//!   5. Operator carries the (encrypted) bundle back across the
//!      air-gap; only the integration can decrypt.
