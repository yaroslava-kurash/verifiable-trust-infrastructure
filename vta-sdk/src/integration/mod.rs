//! Unified VTA integration for service startup.
//!
//! Provides a single startup pattern for any service that manages its DID and
//! secrets through a VTA:
//!
//! 1. Authenticate to the VTA. Tier order is determined by
//!    [`TransportPreference`]: DIDComm first when a mediator is available
//!    (identity-native, no separate auth round-trip), with lightweight REST
//!    + session-REST as fallbacks.
//! 2. Fetch the latest [`DidSecretsBundle`] from the VTA context.
//! 3. Cache the bundle locally for offline resilience.
//! 4. If the VTA is unreachable, load the last cached bundle.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use vta_sdk::integration::{startup, VtaServiceConfig, SecretCache};
//!
//! // Implement SecretCache for your storage backend (keyring, AWS, etc.)
//! struct MyCache { /* ... */ }
//! impl SecretCache for MyCache { /* ... */ }
//!
//! // Quick path — defaults everywhere:
//! let config = VtaServiceConfig::new(loaded_credential_bundle, "my-service");
//!
//! // Or build explicitly when you need to tweak specific fields:
//! // let config = VtaServiceConfig {
//! //     auth: VtaAuthConfig { credential, url_override: None, timeout: None },
//! //     context: VtaContextConfig {
//! //         id: "my-service".into(),
//! //         mediator_did: None,        // auto-resolve from VTA DID doc
//! //         transport_preference: Default::default(), // Auto
//! //         did_resolver: None,        // SDK makes a one-shot on demand
//! //     },
//! // };
//!
//! let cache = MyCache::new();
//!
//! let result = startup(&config, &cache).await?;
//! // result.did — the service's DID
//! // result.bundle.secrets — Vec<SecretEntry> for DIDComm/signing
//! // result.source — whether secrets came from VTA or cache
//! ```
