//! Canonical Trust-Task URIs for every VTA operation.
//!
//! One `pub const` per registered URI; grep `TASK_*` to enumerate the
//! full wire surface. Each URI is routed both on REST (via the
//! trust-task envelope's `type` field on `POST /api/trust-tasks` or
//! a dedicated unauth route) and on DIDComm (via the inbound message
//! `type`).
//!
//! ## URI shape (framework-canonical)
//!
//! ```text
//! https://trusttasks.org/spec/{namespace}/{op-path}/{maj}.{min}
//! ```
//!
//! Per framework SPEC.md §6.1 + the `slug` grammar in
//! `dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf/specs/spec.meta.schema.json` — hierarchical
//! slugs with `/`-delimited path segments are supported (the spec's
//! own example is `acl/grant`). The `/spec/` segment is mandatory;
//! `TypeUri::from_str` rejects URIs missing it (pinned by the
//! `framework_requires_canonical_uri_in_wire_type_field` test in
//! `vta-service::routes::trust_tasks`).
//!
//! Earlier drafts of this workspace used a flat form (no `/spec/`),
//! which deserialised cleanly as a Rust `&'static str` but failed
//! `serde_json::from_slice::<TrustTask<Value>>`. Resolved by adopting
//! the framework's canonical hierarchical-slug form throughout —
//! breaking change made before any external clients existed.
//!
//! ## Namespace
//!
//! - `https://trusttasks.org/spec/vta/...` — VTA operations (this module).
//! - `https://trusttasks.org/spec/did-hosting/...` — webvh-service.
//! - `https://trusttasks.org/spec/webvh/...` — webvh-protocol ops.
//!
//! ## Versioning
//!
//! `{maj}.{min}` only per the canonical Trust-Tasks spec — no patch
//! component. Bumping requires registering a NEW const at a new URL;
//! the old URL keeps routing to its handler until removed in a future
//! release. The router does NOT do version-family matching — `1.0` and
//! `1.1` are completely separate identifiers.
//!
//! ## Cross-crate consistency
//!
//! Every const here is reflected in the migration mapping in
//! `docs/05-design-notes/trust-task-uri-registry.md`. A parity harness
//! in `vta-service::routes::trust_tasks` confirms the dispatcher knows
//! about every const declared here.
//!
//! ## What lives here vs is planned
//!
//! v0.1 of this module ships the **auth slice only** — the six URIs
//! needed for the trust-task migration's Phase 2 "first-light" gate.
//! Remaining slices (keys, contexts, ACL, services, etc., ~70 more
//! URIs) land in Phase 3 of the migration initiative.

// ─── Auth slice — canonical cross-cutting specs ──────────────────────────

// the canonical 0.1 specs. When the canonical specs cure to candidate /
