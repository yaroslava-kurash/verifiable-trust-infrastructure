//! Consumer-side verification of sealed-bundle producer assertions.
//!
//! The producer side constructs a `DidSigned` assertion over
//! `DID_SIGNED_DOMAIN_TAG || client_x25519_pub || bundle_id`
//! (see `vta-service/src/operations/provision_integration.rs::build_did_signed_assertion`).
//! Historically no consumer verified this signature — the bundle-id
//! digest OOB channel was the only in-band anchor. This module closes
//! that gap: given the producer's Ed25519 public-key bytes, confirm the
//! signature is genuine.
//!
//! The helper is deliberately pure — it does **not** resolve DIDs. The
//! caller is expected to resolve `producer_did` (or, for `did:key`,
//! decode it directly), extract the verification method matching the
//! assertion's `verification_method` field, and pass the raw 32-byte
//! Ed25519 public key in. Keeps the sealed-transfer crate free of DID
//! resolver dependencies and lets downstream consumers use whatever
//! resolver they already have.
