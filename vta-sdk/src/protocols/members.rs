//! Member-side membership-credential exchange (`members/*`).
//!
//! Membership between a persona DID and a VTC is a **pair of VMCs**: the VTC
//! issues a `MembershipCredential` to the member at admission
//! (community → member), and the member issues one back to the VTC
//! (member → community), so each side holds a credential asserting the other's
//! membership edge. The join-ceremony `accept` step records a member-issued
//! *acknowledgement*; this family carries the **full reciprocal VMC** and lets
//! it be (re)exchanged at any point after admission:
//!
//! - [`MEMBER_REQUEST_VMC_TYPE`] — VTC → member: "please issue + send your VMC".
//!   Admin-triggered from the VTC; delivered over DIDComm to the member's agent.
//! - [`MEMBER_VMC_TYPE`] — member → VTC: the member-issued VMC (a Data-Integrity
//!   VC whose `issuer` is the member and whose `credentialSubject.id` is the
//!   community DID). The VTC verifies the proof + binding and stores it.
//! - [`MEMBER_VMC_RESPONSE_TYPE`] — VTC → member: a receipt acknowledging the
//!   stored VMC.
