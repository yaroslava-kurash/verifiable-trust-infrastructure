//! `device/*` Trust Task client methods.
//!
//! A `DeviceBinding` is the device-facing half of an `AclEntry`. These methods
//! drive the `device/*` slice through the generic trust-task dispatcher
//! ([`VtaClient::dispatch_trust_task`]) — there is no dedicated REST route.
//! They power the `pnm device …` CLI and the agent-runtime SDK.
//!
//! Registration requires the caller's DID to already be in the ACL
//! (provision-integration mints it via the `ai-agent` template); the caller
//! always acts on its **own** binding.
//!
//! The dispatcher routes the canonical `0.1` task URIs (see
//! `vta-service::trust_tasks::dispatch_table!`); the `#[allow(deprecated)]`
//! mirrors the service-side `REST_ROUTED` allowance — the `0.1` consts are
//! marked deprecated in favour of `0.2`, but `0.1` is what the VTA dispatches.
