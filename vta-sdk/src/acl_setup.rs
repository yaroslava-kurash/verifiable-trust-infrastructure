//! Mediator ACL setup for DIDComm/TSP clients.
//!
//! After a client successfully connects to a mediator, it configures its own per-DID
//! ACL to accept all messages despite potentially restrictive global ACL defaults.
//! This allows the client to receive messages while maintaining the flexibility to set
//! more restrictive ACLs on specific contexts or integrations if needed.
//!
//! Used by both VTA (server startup) and PNM (on DIDComm connect).
//! Gated on the `acl-setup` feature which requires `session` + `trust-tasks-rs`.
//!
//! ## Why this covers both DIDComm *and* TSP
//!
//! The mediator ACL is keyed on the **hashed DID** (`sha256(did)`), not on the
//! transport — it gates the account, not a protocol. On the VTA, DIDComm and TSP
//! are multiplexed over the DID's **single** mediator websocket (one socket per
//! DID; a second is evicted as `duplicate-channel`), so provisioning the DID's
//! ACL once — from the DIDComm-listener start path, which is also the
//! TSP-receive path on a `tsp`-compiled VTA — authorises the account for *both*
//! transports. There is no separate TSP ACL to set.
//!
//! On the client (PNM/CNM) the general request transport (`VtaClient` /
//! `TransportChoice` in `session.rs`) is DIDComm-or-REST: every *persistent*,
//! ACL-needing client connect goes through [`crate::didcomm_session`], which
//! calls this. The SDK's one dedicated *client-side* TSP session,
//! [`crate::session::TspPingSession`], is a transient `pnm health` liveness
//! probe on an ephemeral DID — it opens its own short-lived TSP socket and tears
//! it down, so it deliberately does **not** persist a mediator ACL (that would
//! litter the mediator with allow-all entries for throwaway probe DIDs). A probe
//! against an `ExplicitAllow` mediator is expected to require its DID be
//! pre-authorised.
//!
//! TODO(tsp-client): if/when the general client request transport gains a
//! *persistent* TSP variant (a `Tsp` arm on the `#[non_exhaustive]`
//! `TransportChoice`, or `TspPingSession` generalised into a request session),
//! that connect path must also call [`set_client_acl_on_connection`], or an
//! `ExplicitAllow` mediator will reject it exactly as it did before this
//! feature. The provisioning logic lives here so only the trigger is needed.
