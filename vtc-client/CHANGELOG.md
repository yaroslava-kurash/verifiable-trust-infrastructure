## [0.5.2](https://github.com/yaroslava-kurash/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vtc-client-v0.5.1...vtc-client-v0.5.2) — 2026-09-04


### Added

- **rooms**: Data rooms end to end — storage, dispatch, verification, MLS, and a host ([#1237](https://github.com/yaroslava-kurash/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1237))

* feat(rooms): the data-room storage layer

  A data room is a shared space whose access is governed by credentials the
  room itself issues. This lands the storage and its invariants; the
  Trust-Task dispatch that authorizes operations follows once rooms/* is
  published in the registry (trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#346) - the
  dispatcher refuses a URI the published registry has no schema for, and
  growing the unspecced allowlist is the wrong fix.

  Written first so that the dispatch layer is a thin wrapper over settled
  behaviour rather than a place where storage decisions get made under time
  pressure.

  The row deliberately carries an owner, a visibility, an epoch and a
  retention period, and NO member list. Not omitted for now - there must not
  be one. The moment this service keeps a roster and consults it, three
  things stop being true at once: the room can no longer move to another
  host without reissuing credentials, this service becomes part of the
  room's membership definition, and a room whose contents we cannot read
  acquires a member list we can.

  Invariants enforced in the store rather than trusted to callers, each with
  a test:

  - An open room refuses ciphertext and a sealed room refuses cleartext, so
    a tier promise cannot be broken by a caller passing the wrong shape.
  - A private room refuses a recorded author: on that tier authorship
    belongs inside the sealed body where only members can read it.
  - A record sealed under a stale epoch is refused, because a reader holding
    the current key could not open it.
  - An epoch advances by exactly one. A gap would leave records sealed under
    an epoch nobody holds a key for; a repeat would let a removed member's
    key open material written after their removal, which is the whole point
    of advancing.
  - Versions are monotonic per room, not per record - one comparable number
    is what a sinceVersion watermark needs. A conflict carries the current
    version so a caller need not re-read, because between a bare rejection
    and the re-read the record can change again.
  - A listing returns tombstones to a watermark caller. Without that a
    puller learns of every create and update and never of a delete, so
    retracted records resurrect on its next full rebuild.
  - Retract and purge are separate verbs: a tombstone keeps the key, version
    and epoch so sync converges and the audit chain holds, and erasure is a
    distinct, higher-trust act.

  Keyspaces registered in ALL and BACKED_UP - the two must partition ALL
  exactly - with the census count moved to 27 and the matching AppState
  fields opened, so the documented ALL-matches-AppState invariant stays
  true rather than merely passing a length check.



### Changed

- **rooms**: Move the group-key and sealing layers into vti-rooms ([#1241](https://github.com/yaroslava-kurash/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1241))

A VTA must not depend on a VTC client, and rooms/keys/open needs both
  layers inside vta-service - the VTA is what holds the principal's keys
  and opens a record on an agent's behalf. Today they live in vtc-client,
  so that task could not be written at all without a layering inversion.

  vti-rooms is already the shared home for the parts of a room that are not
  a service, and it is where the ciphertext is stored. Putting the AEAD
  binding beside the storage layer that binds to it closes the other half
  of the argument: the associated data commits to roomId | key | version |
  epoch, and until now the code that seals and the code that stores those
  four fields were in different crates. That is how a binding drifts.

  Both live behind an mls feature, off by default, so a host that only
  stores ciphertext still compiles no OpenMLS.

  SealedRoom no longer holds a RoomSession. It holds the room id and the
  group - and the separation is the honest shape rather than a concession
  to the move: the credentials a caller presents travel to the host on
  every request, and the keys never travel anywhere. Pairing them made a
  client the only place a room could be opened.

  The move surfaced a duplication that was invisible while it compiled.
  vtc-client defined its own Visibility, AuthorityPresentation,
  SealedContent, CleartextContent and three response types, plus all five
  Type URI constants - identical to vti-rooms' and with nothing checking
  they stayed identical. The schema-conformance suite added with the open
  tier validates vti-rooms' copies against the published schemas and could
  not see the client's at all, so those could have drifted freely. They are
  re-exports now, which makes the suite cover both.

  RoomKeyError replaces VtcError for this layer, deliberately not
  vti_common::AppError: a record that does not open is a legitimate outcome
  with a specific meaning, and folding it into Internal would say 'this
  service is broken' about the one case the design most wants to be loud -
  a host relocated a record.



## [0.5.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vtc-client-v0.5.0...vtc-client-v0.5.1) — 2026-08-29


## [0.5.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vtc-client-v0.4.0...vtc-client-v0.5.0) — 2026-08-28


### Chore

- **sdk**: Release vta-sdk 0.30.0 for the added CreateKeyBody field ([#1156](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1156))

`CreateKeyBody` gained a `key_id` field while the crate stayed at 0.29.0.
  The struct is exhaustively constructible through the public API, so an
  existing literal no longer compiles — a breaking change under 0.x rules,
  which the semver report has been flagging as its one real finding
  (195 pass, 1 fail) since the field landed.

  Bumps the crate and the nineteen intra-workspace requirements that pin it,
  so `cargo check --workspace` still resolves the path copy and a consumer
  resolving from the registry gets a version that admits the break.



## [0.4.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vtc-client-v0.3.11...vtc-client-v0.4.0) — 2026-08-26


### Fixed

- **common**: Send the pagination wrapper in camelCase, as the schemas always said ([#1078](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1078))

`Paginated<T>` carried no `rename_all`, so every list task sent `next_cursor`
  and `total_estimate` against published schemas that say `nextCursor` and
  `totalEstimate`. A direct R3.1 violation, and the same casing-drift class as
  #656/#658 — where an empty `allowed_contexts` silently minted a super-admin.

  Nothing caught it because nothing compared the two. The service sent one
  spelling, `vtc-client` mirrored the service rather than the schema, and the
  admin SPA typed its fields from the service too. All three agreed with each
  other and none agreed with the contract. The conformance witness added in
  #1076 is what finally put them side by side.

  Four consumers move together: the wrapper in `vti-common`, `vtc-client`'s
  `Page<T>`, and the `joinRequests` and `members` admin plugins. `audit.tsx`
  reads a `cursor` member of a different shape and is untouched.

  ## The count goes 33 → 32, not 33 → 28

  The witness refused 28 and accepted 32, which is the useful part of this
  change and the reason the module doc is rewritten rather than decremented.

  Five entries cited the wrapper. Only `relationships/list` becomes fully
  conforming, because it was the only one whose drift was the wrapper alone —
  its spec types `items` as free objects. The other four still diverge at row
  level (`createdByDid`, `vpClaims`, `MemberResponse` members) and keep their
  entries, now describing only what is left rather than restating a casing bug
  that is fixed.

  Closing a shared root cause moves four entries without closing them. A drift
  count that fell by five would have implied more progress than happened, and
  `known_drift_entries_still_diverge_where_they_say_they_do` is what stopped it
  saying so.
