## [0.6.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.5.1...vta-tee-v0.6.0) — 2026-09-27


### Added

- **attestation**: The TEE attestation reads are public Trust Tasks, over any transport ([#1776](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1776))

* feat(attestation)!: the TEE attestation reads are public Trust Tasks, over any transport

  A TEE VTA answered three attestation reads only as unauthenticated REST routes
  (`GET /attestation/status`, `GET`/`POST /attestation/report`,
  `POST /attestation/config-report`), plus a bare DIDComm protocol arm that
  nothing sent to. Under the rule that every remote API is a spec-first,
  spine-dispatched Trust Task reachable over TSP, DIDComm and HTTPS, they are now
  `vta/attestation/{status,report,config-report}/0.1` (trustoverip/
  dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#654, trust-tasks-rs 0.23.2), dispatched on the spine.

  Public tasks
  - `vta_sdk::trust_tasks::PUBLIC_URIS` names the tasks a caller may send with no
    identity: no session, no ACL entry, no request proof. A verifier asks before
    it trusts the VTA; the nonce bound into the evidence is what makes a report
    its own, and every response is the VTA's signed operational document.
  - HTTPS: `/trust-tasks` takes an optional credential. An anonymous caller may
    send only a public task (anything else is 401), capped at 64 KB, and those
    requests are charged to the unauthenticated limiter — which charges only
    requests presenting no credential, decided by the extractor's own rule
    (`vti_common::auth::extractor::presents_credential`), so a junk header cannot
    move a request between the two classes.
  - DIDComm/TSP: a sender the ACL does not know gets a zero-authority claim for a
    public task, and `bind_document_to_sender` accepts it unsigned — the spec
    makes the request proof OPTIONAL and HTTPS accepts it unsigned, so refusing it
    here would make the requirement depend on the transport (VTI-OPS-021). An
    attached proof is still verified and bound.
  - A census (`every_public_task_is_proof_optional_and_read_only`) fails if a task
    whose spec requires a proof, or whose dispatch class changes state, discloses
    a secret or acts as its subject, is ever added to `PUBLIC_URIS`.

  Behaviour
  - `report` and `config-report` require a 32-byte verifier nonce; the cached,
    nonce-less report is not carried over — evidence nobody asked for is evidence
    anybody can replay.
  - Failures carry the specs' declared codes: `notAttested` (no provider),
    `noConfigSnapshot` (only the enclave front-end captures one),
    `evidenceUnavailable` (the platform refused a quote).
  - The VTA still requires `issuedAt` on every document (bounding its replay
    record), stricter than the spec; the deploy README examples send it.

  Removed (breaking)
  - The REST routes above and the DIDComm `firstperson.network/vta/1.0/
    attestation/*` arms, with their SDK constants; `TASK_ATTESTATION_{STATUS,
    REPORT}_1_0` become `TASK_ATTESTATION_{STATUS,REPORT,CONFIG_REPORT}_0_1` and
    leave `REST_ROUTED_URIS`.
  - The `TeeAttestation` DID-document service, which pointed at the REST route
    (user decision: removed, not re-pointed). `tee.embed_in_did` and
    `VTA_TEE_EMBED_IN_DID` are **refused** at config load as retired, naming the
    replacement, rather than silently ignored. The shipped Nitro configs drop the
    key; the deploy scripts' health hints point at `/health`.



## [0.5.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.5.0...vta-tee-v0.5.1) — 2026-09-26


## [0.5.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.4.2...vta-tee-v0.5.0) — 2026-09-26


### Fixed

- **vta-service**: Close the key-material follow-ups from the export audit ([#1743](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1743))

* fix(vta-service): apply the key-export and sign capability checks on every transport

  The KeyExport capability was checked only by the keys/export-secret
  Trust-Task handler, so GET /keys/{id}/secret and DIDComm get-key-secret
  released private keys to an admin whose entry was narrowed without
  key-export. Capability::Sign was checked nowhere.

  Both checks now live in the operation layer (VTI-VTA-003, VTI-VTA-007):

  - get_key_secret requires key-export before any lookup, refuses a
    hop-by-hop channel (keys/export-secret/0.1 requires a channel
    confidential to the two parties), keeps the internal-key and
    non-exportable refusals, and writes the key.secret_export audit row
    durably before releasing the material, refusing if it cannot.
  - The Trust-Task binding (https, didcomm, tsp) is recorded at the three
    entry points and named in the export's audit channel.
  - vta/contexts/secrets and provision-integration use the same gate.
  - sign_payload requires sign for opaque caller bytes; derive-and-sign
    and derive-and-sign-document require sign.
  - The legacy REST and DIDComm key routes now consult the policy gate
    with the matching Trust-Task URI.
  - The TEE mnemonic export writes a durable audit row before release.



### Security

- **workspace**: No type derives Debug over secret material ([#1711](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1711))

A derived `Debug` prints every field, so on a type holding a private key, a
  seed or mnemonic, a bearer or refresh token or a password it puts the secret
  into anything that formats the value — a `tracing` field, an `unwrap` or
  `expect` on an enclosing type, a test failure, a panic message. About 55 types
  across twelve crates did exactly that. It surfaced when `vtc-client` began
  holding an operator's key in a `HolderKey`, whose derived `Debug` printed it.

  Each now has a hand-written `Debug` that reports the secret as `<redacted>` —
  presence kept visible for an `Option` — and prints every other field as
  before, the idiom the workspace already used where someone had thought of it.
  Among them: `HolderKey`, `Session`, `ClientIdentity`, `CredentialBundle`,
  `SecretEntry`, `AgentConfig`, `AgentConnect`, `AuthResult`, the key-import and
  seed-rotation requests (mnemonic), `SeedRecord`, `MnemonicExportResponse`,
  `SecretsConfig` (seed, Vault token, AppRole secret id), `VaultSecret`, its
  `CustomField` values and secure notes, `TotpSeed`, the VTC install flow's
  ephemeral signing keys, setup tokens and install JWT, the VTC backup's signing
  bundle and password, mobile-core's X25519 and Ed25519 private keys, auth tokens
  and push tokens (including the Web Push auth secret), and vta-mcp's
  `--agent-key`/`--holder-key`/`--agent-secrets`.

  `Zeroizing<T>` is not a redaction — its `Debug` prints the inner value — so the
  fields wrapped in it were redacted too.

  `vta-sdk/tests/secret_debug_census.rs` keeps the class closed. It parses every
  workspace crate with `syn` and fails on a `#[derive(Debug)]` struct or enum
  whose field has a secret-sounding name (`*_key`, `*token*`, `*secret*`,
  `seed*`, `password`, `mnemonic`, `jwt`, and `secret_id` despite its `_id`)
  and a raw type (`String`, bytes, `Zeroizing<_>`, optionally in an `Option` or
  behind a reference). A field whose type is another workspace type inherits that
  type's `Debug`, which is checked where it is defined. What the name rule
  catches and is not a secret — a claim-type vocabulary token, a webvh path
  called `mnemonic`, the name of an entry in a secret store — is on a
  shrink-only list with what the field holds, and the census also refuses a
  stale entry and a walk that has stopped finding types.

  Not an API change: every type still implements `Debug`; only what it prints
  differs, and no test asserted on the old output.



## [0.4.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.4.1...vta-tee-v0.4.2) — 2026-09-24


## [0.4.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.4.0...vta-tee-v0.4.1) — 2026-09-23


## [0.4.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.3.2...vta-tee-v0.4.0) — 2026-09-22


### Added

- **backup**: A backup is the whole agent, and restores between plain, hardened and TEE VTAs ([#1655](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1655))

A backup now carries every row of every keyspace in vta_keyspaces::BACKED_UP
  (format vta-backup-v2) and restores into a plain, hardened or Nitro-enclave
  VTA from any of them. VTI-VTA-001, VTI-VTA-050, VTI-VTA-051, VTI-KEY-033.



## [0.3.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.3.1...vta-tee-v0.3.2) — 2026-09-22


## [0.3.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.3.0...vta-tee-v0.3.1) — 2026-09-21


## [0.3.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.10...vta-tee-v0.3.0) — 2026-09-21


### Fixed

- **did-webvh**: Serialize versionTime log updates ([#1599](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1599))

* fix(did-webvh): serialize versionTime log updates

  Use one current-time policy for TEE genesis and runtime did:webvh
  updates. Wait for the next valid whole-second boundary, rechecking
  after wall-clock rollback, instead of backdating entries.

  Serialize same-DID log appends within a VTA process and add regression
  coverage for rapid updates, concurrent appends, legacy timestamps, and
  TEE genesis followed by an immediate validated update.



## [0.2.10](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.9...vta-tee-v0.2.10) — 2026-09-20


## [0.2.9](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.8...vta-tee-v0.2.9) — 2026-09-17


## [0.2.8](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.7...vta-tee-v0.2.8) — 2026-09-16


## [0.2.7](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.6...vta-tee-v0.2.7) — 2026-09-16


## [0.2.6](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.5...vta-tee-v0.2.6) — 2026-09-14


### Fixed

- **pnm-cli**: Anchor TEE bootstrap connect by DID and PCR0 ([#1454](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1454))

* fix(pnm-cli): anchor TEE bootstrap connect by DID and PCR0

  Add mutually exclusive --vta-did and --vta-url targets. Resolve WebVH locally without guessing a URL on failure, preserve the advertised REST endpoint, and reject credentials for a different VTA DID.

  Accept a pinned PCR0 as the online connect trust anchor without requiring the server-generated digest or an opt-out warning. Preserve explicit digest opt-out warnings, conflicting-flag errors, and mandatory offline digest verification.

  Add regression tests for target selection, strict endpoint resolution, credential identity checks, and anchor combinations. Update the PNM quick start and TEE bootstrap guide.

- **webvh**: Clamp versionTime against the previous log entry ([#1456](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1456))

* fix(tee): backdate WebVH genesis versionTime

  The TEE genesis path used the library's current-time default while
  runtime updates used PR #600's backdated timestamps. This caused the
  first update to have a lower versionTime than genesis, making the DID
  unresolvable.

  Apply the shared PR #600 backdating policy to TEE genesis and move the
  helper into vta-support so both TEE and service paths use one implementation.



## [0.2.5](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.4...vta-tee-v0.2.5) — 2026-09-12


## [0.2.4](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.3...vta-tee-v0.2.4) — 2026-09-07


## [0.2.3](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.2...vta-tee-v0.2.3) — 2026-09-06


### Fixed

- **tee**: Make allow_kms_reinit explicit authorization for reinit regardless of KMS failure type ([#1249](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1249))

* fix(tee): make allow_kms_reinit explicit authorization for reinit regardless of KMS failure type



## [0.2.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.1...vta-tee-v0.2.2) — 2026-09-01


## [0.2.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.0...vta-tee-v0.2.1) — 2026-08-29


## [0.2.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.10...vta-tee-v0.2.0) — 2026-08-28


### Chore

- **deps**: Aes-gcm 0.11, and stop the nonce conversions panicking ([#1173](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1173))


## [0.1.10](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.9...vta-tee-v0.1.10) — 2026-08-26


## [0.1.9](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.8...vta-tee-v0.1.9) — 2026-08-20


### Fixed

- **tee**: Bootstrap 410 and vsock enotconn ([#1003](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1003))

* fix(tee): retry transient ENOTCONN on first vsock config-overlay read

  tokio-vsock can report a stream connected just before Nitro finishes the
  nonblocking handshake, so the very first read on a fresh vsock:5800
  connection to the parent config server can return ENOTCONN even though
  the parent is listening and ready. Retry only that specific transient
  error kind with a short delay; any other I/O error still fails closed
  immediately, and the existing overall READ_TIMEOUT deadline still
  bounds the whole fetch.

  Adds positive (retries ENOTCONN then succeeds) and negative (does not
  retry PermissionDenied) unit tests against the inner read loop.



## [0.1.8](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.7...vta-tee-v0.1.8) — 2026-08-16


## [0.1.7](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.6...vta-tee-v0.1.7) — 2026-08-14


### Added

- **nitro**: Un-bake tenant config, deliver to the enclave over vsock ([#939](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/939))

* feat(nitro): un-bake tenant config, deliver to the enclave over vsock

  The Nitro enclave image no longer bakes tenant config.toml into the EIF, so one image (one PCR0) serves every tenant. The entrypoint fetches a versioned config envelope from the parent over vsock:5800 (bounded connect/read timeouts, 1 MB size cap, version check), fails closed unless VTA_ALLOW_DEFAULT_CONFIG=true, and writes /etc/vta/config.toml before start. Adds jq to the runtime; documents the KMS-policy isolation requirement and the tee-mode enforcement floor.



## [0.1.6](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.5...vta-tee-v0.1.6) — 2026-08-13


### Added

- **release**: Publish vta-service and its closure again ([#962](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/962))

* feat(release): publish vta-service and its closure again

  #938 unpublished `vta-service` and the twelve subsystem crates behind it,
  on the finding that nothing external depended on them. The audit read
  normal dependencies. `openvtc-core` depends on `vta-service` as a
  **dev-dependency**, for `test_support::MockVta` — an in-process VTA its
  end-to-end tests run against. That harness boots the real service, so no
  client crate can stand in for it.

  Unpublishing did not merely freeze the crate. It broke it.

  `vti-common` re-exports `vta_sdk::acl::{ActScope, ApproveScope,
  ContextDirection}` as its own public API, so **a re-export makes the
  re-exported crate's version part of your public API**: any graph
  combining `vti-common` with another `vta-sdk` consumer must resolve one
  `vta-sdk`. The frozen `vta-service` 0.14.37 asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21`
  while `vti-common` has moved to `^0.23`. A downstream `cargo update`
  resolves both and `vta-service` fails to compile with

    expected `vti_common::acl::ApproveScope`,
       found `vta_sdk::acl::ApproveScope`

  at ten call sites — which is how this surfaced, in openvtc #213. Nothing
  downstream can fix that; only a release that moves the requirements
  together can.

  So the thirteen manifests go back to the workspace default. The cost is
  the closure — twelve subsystem crates return to crates.io, which is
  exactly what #938 set out to stop. Taken deliberately over the
  alternatives: yanking the published copies breaks OpenVTC's tests with no
  replacement, and leaving them up ships a crate on the registry that
  cannot be built.

  **On release ordering.** `cargo publish --dry-run -p vta-service` fails
  today, and will until the closure is on the registry: packaging strips
  path deps, so `vta-keys = "0.2"` resolves the *published* 0.2.1, which
  still asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21` — two nodes, same error. That resolves
  itself in the release, which publishes in dependency order: every
  subsystem crate in this workspace already requires `vta-sdk = "0.23"`, so
  once they upload, `vta-service` verifies against them. Crates whose
  dependencies are all published already dry-run clean (verified on
  `vta-keyspaces` and `vta-config`).

  Docs updated to match: CLAUDE.md, RELEASING.md and the release-plz.toml
  header all said 7-of-21. They now say 20-of-26, name the six that stay
  internal, and record the rule the audit missed — check dev-dependencies,
  in sibling repos, before unpublishing anything.



### Build & CI

- **release**: Adopt release-plz, publish 7 crates instead of 21 ([#938](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/938))

Merging and releasing were the same act. publish.yml fired on every push to
  main and shipped whatever versions were newly present, and a CI guard required
  the version bump to live in the feature PR — so every PR was a release
  decision, taken by whoever opened it, days before it merged. Two open PRs
  touching one crate wrote the same number into the same line of the same
  Cargo.toml, and the second to merge had to rebase, renumber, and fix a
  changelog entry that had gone stale. #932/#936/#937 hit it three times in one
  afternoon.
