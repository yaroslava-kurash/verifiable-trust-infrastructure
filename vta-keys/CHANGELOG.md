### Added

- **did-webvh**: Mint the keys a template's `keys` block asks for ([#1555](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1555))

* fix(did-templates): a key slot beyond the historical pair, and the literal it used to publish

  `slot_var`'s `{SLOT}_KEY_MB` rule is mechanical, and before this it was
  mechanical in one direction only. A `schemaVersion` 2 template could *declare* a
  third key slot — a post-quantum signing key beside the classical pair, which is
  the shape a hybrid-credential issuer needs — and then could not be loaded,
  because the placeholder that slot's own rule produces was rejected:

      Invalid("undeclared placeholder(s) { PQ_SIGNING_KEY_MB } in document
               — add them to requiredVars or optionalVars")

  Only `SIGNING_KEY_MB` and `KA_KEY_MB` were ambient, because only those two are
  in `RESERVED_VARS`. So `keys` at schemaVersion 2 ([#1530](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1530)) could express exactly
  the pair it was introduced to move beyond.

  ## Following the error's advice published a literal into a write-once log

  The advice is the defect. `optionalVars` supplies a **default**, and the
  renderer substitutes a default for any name the caller did not supply — and the
  minting flow does not supply a slot's key under a name it has never heard of.
  So declaring `PQ_SIGNING_KEY_MB` to get past the rejection passed validation
  *and rendered*:

      {
        "id": "did:webvh:x#key-2",
        "type": "Multikey",
        "publicKeyMultibase": "PLACEHOLDER-NEVER-SUBSTITUTED"
      }

  — inside `assertionMethod`, in a `did:webvh` log that is signed once and cannot
  be re-signed. `check_key_slots` already refuses a slot the document never
  publishes: a key minted and thrown away. This is the same failure wearing the
  other hat, a key published and never minted, and it arrived through the one door
  that check does not watch.

  ## What changes

  - `DidTemplate::slot_vars()` — the placeholder names the declared slots occupy,
    built from `key_slots()` rather than a second fixed list. For a v1 template it
    is exactly the two already in `RESERVED_VARS`, so v1 behaviour is untouched;
    it is what lets a v2 template name a third slot at all.
  - `check_placeholders_declared` treats those names as ambient. An author cannot
    declare a value they have no way to know.
  - `check_slot_vars_not_declared` refuses the reverse — a slot's placeholder in
    `requiredVars` or `optionalVars` — naming the slot and saying why. A v1
    template still gets `ReservedVar` from the check that runs first, unchanged.
  - An undeclared placeholder that is *shaped* like a slot's is told to declare a
    **slot**, not a variable. The generic advice pointed at exactly what the new
    check refuses; an error that recommends the defect is worse than no error.

  ## The state this leaves

  A third slot is expressible, and a VTA that cannot yet mint for it fails at
  render with `Unresolved` naming the placeholder — rather than emitting a
  document with a hole in it. Wiring derivation to the `keys` block is the next
  change; until then the loud failure is the correct one.

  Found while tracing what stands between a VTC and a second signing key: nothing
  in the chain from template to `LocalSigner::with_additional_key` could carry one.



## [0.6.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.5.2...vta-keys-v0.6.0) — 2026-09-17


### Added

- **keys**: A derived key carries the algorithm it was minted with ([#1532](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1532))

* feat(keys)!: a derived key carries the algorithm it was minted with

  `DerivedEntityKeys` gains `signing_key_type` / `ka_key_type`, and
  `derive_entity_keys_with_preference` mints the first algorithm a template's
  `keys` block asks for that this build can produce.

  ## The defect this closes

  Every `save_key_record` call for a signing key passed the algorithm as a
  literal:

      save_key_record(ks, &vm_ids.signing, &derived.signing_path,
                      SdkKeyType::Ed25519,        // asserted, not carried
                      &derived.signing_pub, ...)

  Correct only while nothing else could be minted. The moment a template can ask
  for ML-DSA, that record names an algorithm the key is not — and a later signing
  operation reaches for a suite the key cannot work in, failing somewhere far from
  the place that decided wrongly. Same shape as the verificationMethod
  mislabelling fixed in #1528, one layer down: a type asserted where it should
  have been carried.

  The imported-key path reads the type from the stored `KeyRecord` rather than
  assuming, because for an imported key the record is where the truth about its
  algorithm lives — assuming Ed25519 there would mislabel an imported ML-DSA key
  at the one moment the system is being told what it is.

  ## Deviation from the plan, deliberately

  The plan said `DerivedEntityKeys` grows "from two fixed fields to a slot map".
  Counting the call sites changed the answer: the two slots are used in 53 places,
  and a map turns every one into a lookup that can fail while *removing* a
  property that is true and worth holding in the type — a DID document has exactly
  one signing key and at most one key-agreement key. `slots["signing"]` returning
  `Option` is a worse description of reality than a field that cannot be absent.

  What the plan was really asking is that a slot's **algorithm** stop being
  implied, which is what the two new fields do. A third slot — two signing keys at
  once, for hybrid credentials — has no consumer until Phase 3, and an empty map
  now would be a mechanism with no users, the thing this plan criticises elsewhere
  about `sign_multi`. The reasoning is recorded on the struct.

  ## Preference semantics

  An algorithm this build cannot mint is **skipped**, not refused — that is what a
  fallback is for, and refusing would make `["mldsa44", "ed25519"]` useless on a
  VTA without post-quantum support. Running out is an error naming what was asked
  for, never a quiet downgrade to Ed25519: the quiet downgrade is the whole
  hazard, because a deployment meant to be post-quantum would ship classical keys
  and nothing would say so.

  The key-agreement slot takes no preference. X25519 is the only algorithm that
  can serve it in a DID document; ML-KEM key agreement is TSP's hybrid KEM, not a
  verification method.

  ## Breaking

  `DerivedEntityKeys` gains two fields, so struct literals no longer compile —
  two in `vta-service`, fixed here.

  Three tests. The one that matters asserts the recorded type and the actual key
  **agree**, and was checked for non-vacuity by making them diverge: it fails with
  "signing_key_type says ML-DSA-44 but the key is 34 bytes".



## [0.5.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.5.1...vta-keys-v0.5.2) — 2026-09-16


## [0.5.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.5.0...vta-keys-v0.5.1) — 2026-09-16


### Added

- **keys**: Derive ML-DSA keys from the BIP-32 chain ([#1505](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1505))

`Bip32Extension` gains `derive_ml_dsa_44` and `derive_ml_dsa_65`, and the five
  sites that refused post-quantum derivation now do it: key creation, both export
  paths, and the offline `vta keys secrets` CLI. This is what stands between "a
  `KeyRecord` can carry a post-quantum key" and "a VTA can mint one".

  ## Domain separation is the whole of it

  `derive_ed25519` hands the SLIP-0010 output straight to the key constructor, and
  FIPS 204 KeyGen takes a 32-byte seed — so the obvious implementation lines up,
  compiles, and is wrong: **the ML-DSA seed would equal the Ed25519 private key at
  the same path**, and compromising either would yield the other. Both values are
  32 bytes, which is exactly why it reads as correct.

  `derive_p256` already solved this, and these follow its construction exactly —
  HMAC-SHA512 over the derived signing key and chain code, keyed by a label, first
  32 bytes taken. The label differs *per parameter set*, because ML-DSA-44 and
  ML-DSA-65 are different algorithms and a holder of one must not be able to
  reconstruct the other.

  `ml_dsa_seed_is_independent_of_the_ed25519_key_at_the_same_path` is the test for
  it, and it is not theoretical: built against the naive version it fails with
  exactly that message. `the_two_ml_dsa_parameter_sets_get_independent_seeds`
  covers the second half.

  Simpler than P-256 in one respect — xi is 32 arbitrary bytes with no
  group-order constraint, so there is no reduction and no retry.

  The shared helper exists because the two derivations differ only in the label,
  and a second copy is how they would eventually disagree about how a seed is
  produced. That is unrecoverable rather than merely wrong: the key cannot be
  re-derived afterwards.

  ## Internal keys still refuse, and the comment now says why

  Not blocked on cryptography any more — `affinidi_crypto::ml_dsa` signs and this
  change derives. What is missing is a decision. An internal key is deliberately
  the opposite of a derived one: CSPRNG-generated, no derivation path, absent from
  the mnemonic, so losing the keyspace loses it and everything it authorises.
  Whether a VTA should hold an *unrecoverable* post-quantum signing key is a
  question about that trade, and it should not be inherited from a change whose
  subject was derivation.

  Enables `affinidi-secrets-resolver`'s `ml-dsa` feature, which nothing in this
  workspace had turned on — so `Secret::generate_ml_dsa_44` was not compiled here
  at all.

  121 test suites green under `--no-fail-fast`, clippy clean under `-D warnings`,
  rustfmt clean.



## [0.5.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.4.9...vta-keys-v0.5.0) — 2026-09-16


### Added

- **keys**: ML-DSA key types, and one codec table instead of two ([#1502](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1502))


## [0.4.9](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.4.8...vta-keys-v0.4.9) — 2026-09-14


### Fixed

- **webvh**: Key records follow the document's verification-method ids, and a repair for the ones that don't ([#1466](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1466))

* fix(webvh): name a created DID's key records after the document it published

  A key record's id **is** a verification-method id. `save_entity_key_records`
  says so in its own name, and `vta_sdk::did_secrets::select_secret_kid` rule 1
  depends on it: the kid a mediator matches inbound JWE recipients against is the
  record id, on the reasoning that "the DID document decided what the key is
  called".

  Create never read the document to find out. It named the records `{did}#key-0`
  and `{did}#key-1` while the document was whatever the caller or the template
  said — and the `room` and `room-host` built-in templates number their methods
  from `#key-1`. So on every room and every room host this VTA has ever minted:

  - the document's `#key-1` is the **signing** key and the keystore's `#key-1` is
    the **x25519** one. One name, two keys, no error anywhere. Hand the id the
    document publishes to `keys/sign` — the natural thing to do, having read it
    off the document — and the oracle fetches an x25519 record for an EdDSA
    signature;
  - the document's `keyAgreement` (`#key-2`) matches no record at all, so an
    authcrypt message addressed to it finds no local secret. That is the storm.ws
    outage of #337 reached from the other side: there a decorative label
    overwrote the right kid, here the right kid was never stored;
  - `next_fragment_id` was stored as the constant 2, so the DID's first rotation
    allocates `#key-2` — over the id its key-agreement method is already
    published under.

  Room credentials still verify, which is why this stayed quiet: `RoomKeySigner`
  hardcodes `{room_did}#key-1` to match the template, and the public keys line up
  positionally, so the proof names a method that resolves to the key that signed
  it. Everything that addresses a key *by name* is what breaks.

  ## The fix reads the document rather than renumbering the templates



## [0.4.8](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.4.7...vta-keys-v0.4.8) — 2026-09-12


## [0.4.7](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.4.6...vta-keys-v0.4.7) — 2026-09-10


## [0.4.5](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.4.4...vta-keys-v0.4.5) — 2026-09-09

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.4.0...vta-keys-v0.4.1) — 2026-08-29


## [0.4.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.3.0...vta-keys-v0.4.0) — 2026-08-28


### Chore

- **deps**: Aes-gcm 0.11, and stop the nonce conversions panicking ([#1173](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1173))
- **sdk**: Release vta-sdk 0.30.0 for the added CreateKeyBody field ([#1156](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1156))

`CreateKeyBody` gained a `key_id` field while the crate stayed at 0.29.0.
  The struct is exhaustively constructible through the public API, so an
  existing literal no longer compiles — a breaking change under 0.x rules,
  which the semver report has been flagging as its one real finding
  (195 pass, 1 fail) since the field landed.

  Bumps the crate and the nineteen intra-workspace requirements that pin it,
  so `cargo check --workspace` still resolves the path copy and a consumer
  resolving from the registry gets a version that admits the break.



## [0.3.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.2.9...vta-keys-v0.3.0) — 2026-08-26


### Chore

- **deps**: Bring every dependency to latest, collapsing two duplicates ([#1055](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1055))

`cargo outdated` reported 13 direct dependencies behind and `cargo update`
  had 36 compatible updates waiting. Both are now clear: `cargo outdated`
  reports "All dependencies are up to date".

  Two of these were not cosmetic.

  **p256 was duplicated in the build.** Our crates declared `0.13` while
  `affinidi-crypto` — reached through `affinidi-data-integrity` and the TDK —
  already pulled `0.14`, so the graph carried two copies of a curve
  implementation. The lock now holds a single `p256 0.14.0`. The bump brings
  `elliptic-curve` 0.14 and `ecdsa` 0.17, which rename the SEC1 family:
  `EncodedPoint` -> `Sec1Point`, `From/ToEncodedPoint` -> `From/ToSec1Point`.
  Renamed across `vta-keys`, `vta-service` and `vti-webauthn`.

  **tokio-tungstenite was load-bearing, not incidental.** `vta-mobile-core`
  depends on it solely as a feature enabler: iOS has no native trust store, so
  `rustls-tls-webpki-roots` has to be on graph-wide or the mediator WebSocket
  fails with "no native root CA certificates found". Features unify per major
  version, so the declaration only works while it matches the version
  `affinidi-messaging-sdk` pulls — and the SDK moved to 0.30 in this refresh.
  Updating everything *except* this one would have stranded the enabler and
  broken iOS `wss://` silently.

  The rest:

  - `rcgen` 0.13 -> 0.14 (dev). `signed_by` takes an `Issuer` rather than a
    `(certificate, key)` pair, and `self_signed` borrows instead of consuming.
    The mdoc IACA test helper builds its issuer with `Issuer::from_params`,
    which is also a more direct statement of what it wanted.
  - `syn` 2 -> 3 (dev). No source change; syn 3 was already in the graph via
    `trust-tasks-rs`.
  - `rmcp` 1.7 -> 3.1.4. Two majors, one rename: `Content` -> `ContentBlock`.
    The `#[tool_router]` / `#[tool_handler]` macro surface the crate is built
    on is unchanged.
  - 36 lockfile updates, including `trust-tasks-rs` 0.11.3 (the corrected
    `vta/app-state` error taxonomy from dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#253) and the AWS
    SDK set. `rustls-pemfile`, one of the unmaintained crates `cargo audit`
    flags, drops out of the graph entirely.

  Two deliberate choices where the shortest path was worse:

  `vti-webauthn` keeps parse-then-validate rather than collapsing to the
  one-shot `PublicKey::from_sec1_bytes`. That call merges "malformed SEC1
  encoding" and "valid encoding, point not on the curve" into one error, and
  those say different things to whoever reads the log — a broken client versus
  a point somebody chose.

  BIP-32 P-256 derivation replaces the now-deprecated `FieldBytes::from_slice`
  with `TryFrom` and a real error arm. The input is a fixed 32-byte window of a
  SHA-512 HMAC so it cannot fail, but the length check is now explicit rather
  than resting on a panic inside a deprecated helper.

  Unchanged and still suppressed: the four `cargo audit` advisories ignored in
  `deny.toml`, all transitive through the AWS SDK's hyper 0.14 / rustls 0.21
  path. `cargo deny check advisories` passes.

## [0.2.5](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.2.4...vta-keys-v0.2.5) — 2026-08-17


### Added

- **vta-keys**: Add non-extractable internal signing keys ([#995](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/995))

An ordinary VTA key is BIP-32 derived, so anyone holding the 24-word mnemonic
  can reconstruct it offline. That is what makes the VTA recoverable, and equally
  what makes "the operator cannot obtain this key" false — the second limb of what
  eIDAS calls sole control.

  An internal key is generated from the system CSPRNG, has no derivation path, and
  is never returned by any surface. The VTA acts only as a signing oracle for it.

  Deliberately not a flag on the imported-key path. That path wraps its secrets
  under a KEK derived from the master seed (derive_kek(seed, salt)), so a
  non-extractable flag on it would be decorative: the boundary it claims to
  enforce has already been walked around. Internal keys get their own keyspace,
  INTERNAL_KEYS, with no seed involvement at any point, and that keyspace is in
  EXCLUDED_FROM_BACKUP by design — a backup carrying it would be an export of keys
  the VTA promises never to export, and restoring it elsewhere would clone a
  signer.

  Refused for did:webvh log entries, enforced in code rather than left to
  guidance. WebVH is append-only and each entry is authorised by the update key
  the previous entry named; an unrecoverable update key means that if storage is
  lost the DID can never be updated again by anyone, permanently, and every
  integration pinned to it is stranded. Credentials can be re-issued, an
  append-only identity log cannot. Internal keys remain fine as a signing
  verificationMethod inside a published document, where loss costs the ability to
  produce new signatures rather than control of the identity.

  The export refusal is not a permission check — admin is not a bypass, because
  the value of the origin is that no caller holds this power. There are two
  refusals (an early return and an in-match arm); removing either leaves the other,
  and removing both does not compile, since the match over KeyOrigin becomes
  non-exhaustive. An export path cannot silently reopen.

  Operator surfaces carry the cost prominently: `pnm keys create --internal`
  prints what is lost and requires the operator to type a confirmation phrase
  rather than mash y, the response repeats the warning, and docs/02-vta/
  internal-keys.md covers when to use one, what actually protects it (enclave
  measurement + KMS, not a mnemonic), and the two things that genuinely destroy
  it.



## [0.2.4](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.2.3...vta-keys-v0.2.4) — 2026-08-16


## [0.2.3](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.2.2...vta-keys-v0.2.3) — 2026-08-16


## [0.2.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keys-v0.2.1...vta-keys-v0.2.2) — 2026-08-13


### Added

- **release**: Publish vta-service and its closure again ([#962](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/962))

* feat(release): publish vta-service and its closure again

  #938 unpublished `vta-service` and the twelve subsystem crates behind it,
  on the finding that nothing external depended on them. The audit read
  normal dependencies. `openvtc-core` depends on `vta-service` as a
  **dev-dependency**, for `test_support::MockVta` — an in-process VTA its
  end-to-end tests run against. That harness boots the real service, so no
  client crate can stand in for it.

  Unpublishing did not merely freeze the crate. It broke it.

  `vti-common` re-exports `vta_sdk::acl::{ActScope, ApproveScope,
  ContextDirection}` as its own public API, so **a re-export makes the
  re-exported crate's version part of your public API**: any graph
  combining `vti-common` with another `vta-sdk` consumer must resolve one
  `vta-sdk`. The frozen `vta-service` 0.14.37 asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21`
  while `vti-common` has moved to `^0.23`. A downstream `cargo update`
  resolves both and `vta-service` fails to compile with

    expected `vti_common::acl::ApproveScope`,
       found `vta_sdk::acl::ApproveScope`

  at ten call sites — which is how this surfaced, in openvtc #213. Nothing
  downstream can fix that; only a release that moves the requirements
  together can.

  So the thirteen manifests go back to the workspace default. The cost is
  the closure — twelve subsystem crates return to crates.io, which is
  exactly what #938 set out to stop. Taken deliberately over the
  alternatives: yanking the published copies breaks OpenVTC's tests with no
  replacement, and leaving them up ships a crate on the registry that
  cannot be built.

  **On release ordering.** `cargo publish --dry-run -p vta-service` fails
  today, and will until the closure is on the registry: packaging strips
  path deps, so `vta-keys = "0.2"` resolves the *published* 0.2.1, which
  still asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21` — two nodes, same error. That resolves
  itself in the release, which publishes in dependency order: every
  subsystem crate in this workspace already requires `vta-sdk = "0.23"`, so
  once they upload, `vta-service` verifies against them. Crates whose
  dependencies are all published already dry-run clean (verified on
  `vta-keyspaces` and `vta-config`).

  Docs updated to match: CLAUDE.md, RELEASING.md and the release-plz.toml
  header all said 7-of-21. They now say 20-of-26, name the six that stay
  internal, and record the rule the audit missed — check dev-dependencies,
  in sibling repos, before unpublishing anything.



### Build & CI

- **release**: Adopt release-plz, publish 7 crates instead of 21 ([#938](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/938))

Merging and releasing were the same act. publish.yml fired on every push to
  main and shipped whatever versions were newly present, and a CI guard required
  the version bump to live in the feature PR — so every PR was a release
  decision, taken by whoever opened it, days before it merged. Two open PRs
  touching one crate wrote the same number into the same line of the same
  Cargo.toml, and the second to merge had to rebase, renumber, and fix a
  changelog entry that had gone stale. #932/#936/#937 hit it three times in one
  afternoon.
