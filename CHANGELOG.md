# Changelog

## 0.5.0 — 2026-04-24

The `sealed-bootstrap` release: every secret-bearing transfer between
VTA, integrations, and CLIs now moves as an HPKE-sealed bundle, and
DID minting is template-driven.

### Added

- **Sealed-transfer wire format** (`vta-sdk::sealed_transfer`) —
  HPKE-AEAD envelope (X25519-HKDF-SHA256 + ChaCha20-Poly1305),
  OpenPGP-style ASCII armor with CRC24 line checksums, and a tagged
  `SealedPayloadV1` enum covering admin credentials, context
  provision bundles, DID secrets, admin key sets, raw private keys,
  and template-bootstrap payloads. One format, one seal/open path,
  one set of tamper tests for every secret we move.
- **Provision-integration flow** — a holder posts a VP-framed
  `BootstrapRequest` naming a DID template + variables; the VTA
  mints keys, renders the template, registers the holder in the
  ACL, issues a `VtaAuthorizationCredential` (W3C VC + Data
  Integrity), seals the whole bundle to the holder's X25519, and
  returns armored output. Works over three transports (offline
  file, PNM REST bridge, DIDComm) through the same library function.
- **DID templates feature** — declarative JSON describing the shape
  of a DID document with `{TOKEN}` placeholders. Four built-ins ship
  with the SDK (`didcomm-mediator`, `vta-admin`,
  `webvh-hosting-server`, `webvh-service`). Operators can upload
  global or context-scoped custom templates via REST / DIDComm. See
  `docs/did-templates.md`.
- **`webvh-service` built-in template** — generic webvh DID for
  control plane, DID-hosting server, witness, and watcher services
  that route DIDComm through a shared mediator DID.
- **TEE Mode B bootstrap** — `pnm bootstrap connect --vta-url`
  performs a one-command attested first-boot against a fresh Nitro
  enclave. The `/bootstrap/request` carve-out closes permanently on
  first success. Full Nitro attestation verification (COSE_Sign1 +
  cert chain + PCR match) in `pnm-cli` via the `attest-verify`
  feature.
- **Cold-start admin credential flow** — unified temp-did:key flow
  with auto-rotation to a fresh did:key on first authenticated call.
  `vta import-did` seeds the temp DID into the ACL offline; PNM
  completes the handshake + rotation in one `pnm setup` run.
- **Non-interactive VTA setup** — `vta setup --from <file>` for
  CI / sealed images / unattended bootstrap. See
  `docs/non-interactive-setup.md`.
- **Persistent bundle-id anti-replay store** — sealed-transfer nonce
  reuse rejected via fjall-backed `PersistentNonceStore`.
- **Rate limiting** on unauth routes (`/bootstrap/request`,
  `/auth/*`, public `/did/{did}/log`): 5 rps + 10 burst per IP via
  `tower-governor`.

### Changed

- **MSRV bumped to Rust 1.94.0.**
- **Replaced `rsa` crate with `aws-lc-rs`** for the KMS CMS envelope
  unwrap in the Nitro attested bootstrap path. Drops RUSTSEC-2023-0071
  exposure; constant-time OAEP via BoringSSL heritage. Also dropped
  the SHA-1 MGF1 OAEP fallback (AWS KMS always uses symmetric
  `RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256`).
- **Replaced plaintext credential / DID-secret transfer** with sealed
  bundles everywhere. Plaintext `encode/decode` helpers on bundle
  types are gone — the only way to move secrets is through
  `sealed_transfer::seal_payload` + `open_bundle`.
- **`VtaError::Protocol(String)`** split into typed DIDComm variants
  (`UnsupportedTransport`, `DidcommTransport`, `DidcommRemote`)
  so the CLI can emit operator-specific remediation.
- **Client-side keygen for admin credential issuance** — the VTA no
  longer returns raw secret material. Clients mint their Ed25519
  locally and register the public DID via ACL.
- **`TemplateBootstrap` payload** is now the canonical integration
  bundle shape; replaces ad-hoc `ContextProvisionBundle` exports.
- **Coordinated RustCrypto 0.11 ecosystem bump**: `sha2` 0.10→0.11,
  `hmac` 0.12→0.13, `hkdf` 0.12→0.13, `aes` 0.8→0.9, `cbc` 0.1→0.2.
- **Azure crates bumped**: `azure_identity` 0.33→0.35,
  `azure_security_keyvault_secrets` 0.12→0.14.

### Security

Design-review hardening pass (see CLAUDE.md for the full write-up):

- **S-1** KMS attested-only on real Nitro hardware. Previously a
  transient NSM hiccup silently downgraded to an IAM-only KMS call,
  bypassing PCR-enforced policy. Now terminal unless
  `tee.kms.allow_unattested_fallback = true`.
- **S-2** JWT key fingerprint no longer silently re-baselines on
  missing record. Operators migrating from a pre-fingerprint VTA
  opt in explicitly via `tee.kms.allow_fingerprint_init`.
- **S-3** Constant-time challenge + DID compare on `/auth/`.
- **S-4** `AuthClaims::local_cli` renamed to
  `unsafe_local_cli_super_admin` and feature-gated behind
  `cli-synthesis`. Enclave builds cannot compile a call to it.
  Added a separate `server_internal_super_admin` for the library-
  internal privilege-elevation case.
- **S-5** `verify_producer_assertion_with_pubkey` now returns a
  `VerifiedAssertion` typestate (`DidSignedVerified` /
  `PinnedOnlyAcknowledged` / `AttestedNeedsNitroCheck`). Callers
  must match exhaustively — no more silent `Ok(())` for Attested.
- **S-6** `TeeProvider::verify(report) -> bool` renamed to
  `smoke_check_structure(report) -> StructuralCheckOutcome` with
  doc comments spelling out that this is structural only, not
  cryptographic verification.
- **S-7** Refresh tokens keyed by SHA-256 in the session reverse-
  index. A storage dump now yields hashes, not live credentials.
- **S-8** `validate_identifier` on context-id and template-name at
  the DID-template operations boundary. Guards against
  `{context}:{name}` → `tpl:ctx:a:b:c` keyspace injection.
- **S-9** Backup import rejects mismatched `vta_did`. Fresh installs
  accept any backup (disaster recovery); running VTAs refuse to
  overwrite their identity with a foreign backup.
- **S-10** `open_bundle` couples `PinnedOnly` producer assertions to
  an OOB digest at the type level via `PinnedOnlyPolicy`.
- **Backup encryption** uses Argon2id (m=64 MiB, t=3, p=4) +
  AES-256-GCM with 12-char minimum password and AEAD tag check.

### Tests

Reference-quality coverage across foundation crates:

- **T-1** vsock-store wire-format tests (25) — protocol constants,
  encode/decode tamper cases, request payload shape.
- **T-2** ACL unit tests (26) — CRUD, role assignment matrix,
  context-scope visibility, expiration boundary, serde
  forward-compat with pre-`expires_at` entries.
- **T-3** JWT rejection tests (7) — expired, tampered signature,
  `alg=none`, foreign signer, missing required claims, empty,
  malformed shape.
- **T-4** Session lifecycle tests (17) — CRUD, refresh-token S-7
  regression guard, cleanup of expired sessions.
- **T-5** vtc-service wire-shape + config parse tests (18).
- **Mutation-coverage suite** for VP verify in
  `provision_integration/request.rs` — bit-flip in nonce, ask,
  `validUntil`, admin template, type arrays.
- **Sealed-transfer adversarial suite** — armor CRC24 tamper, AAD
  tamper caught by AEAD, missing chunk, nonce replay, wrong
  recipient, PinnedOnly-without-digest rejection.

### Refactored

- `vta-service/src/operations/provision_integration.rs` (1942 lines)
  split into `mod.rs` + `mint` + `preconditions` + `templates` +
  `vta_keys` + `webvh` submodules.
- `vta-service/src/operations/did_webvh.rs` (1444 lines) split into
  `mod.rs` + `document` + `lifecycle` + `servers`.
- `vta-service/src/setup/` split into `interactive` + `from_toml`.
- New `vta-service/src/test_support` for the shared test harness.

### Removed

- **`/auth/credentials` endpoint and `VtaClient::auth_credential_*`
  client methods** — clients mint did:key locally and register the
  DID in the ACL; the VTA never holds the private key.
- **Plaintext `encode/decode` helpers** on `CredentialBundle`,
  `ContextProvisionBundle`, `DidSecretsBundle`, `AdminKeySet`,
  `RawPrivateKey` — the only way to move these is via
  `sealed_transfer`.
- **`rsa` and `sha1` crates** from direct dependencies.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-04-15

### Added

- **`VtaClient` and `DIDCommSession` are now `Clone`** — Cloning a
  `VtaClient` is cheap; clones share the underlying HTTP connection pool
  and authentication state via `Arc<Mutex>`, avoiding redundant auth
  round-trips.
- **Cold-start bootstrap guide** (`docs/cold-start-guide.md`) —
  Step-by-step walkthrough for bootstrapping a VTA + Mediator + WebVH
  environment from scratch.

### Changed

- **Consolidated security documentation** — Merged `threat-model.md`
  and `security-architecture.md` into a single `docs/security.md`.
  Removed stale `docs/VTA_Service_Overview.md` and
  `docs/store-migration.md`.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **Upgrade to `affinidi-messaging-didcomm-service` v0.2** — Both VTA
  and VTC now use the v0.2 DIDComm service framework, which provides
  production-ready lifecycle management for mediator connections.
- **VTA DIDComm bridge simplified** — The bridge no longer captures the
  listener's ATM from handler context. Instead, it uses
  `DIDCommService::send_message_with_retry()` for resilient delivery
  with exponential backoff across mediator reconnects, and
  `listener_did()` for dynamic DID lookup.
- **VTA startup blocks until mediator is ready** — The server now calls
  `wait_connected()` after starting the DIDComm service, ensuring the
  mediator connection is established before accepting REST traffic.
- **VTC migrated to DIDComm service framework** — Replaced the manual
  ATM/WebSocket dispatch loop with `DIDCommService` + `Router`. VTC
  now gets automatic reconnection, typed message routing, and lifecycle
  event logging for free.

### Added

- **DIDComm lifecycle event logging** — Both VTA and VTC log mediator
  connection events (`Connected`, `Disconnected`, `Restarting`) via
  the service's `subscribe()` broadcast channel.

### Removed

- **`vta-sdk::didcomm_init`** — Manual ATM/WebSocket/profile setup
  module removed. All DIDComm connection management is now handled by
  `DIDCommService`.
- **`vta-sdk::didcomm_transport`** — The `send_and_wait_raw` function
  and `DIDCommSendParams` struct removed. The `PendingMap` type has
  moved into the VTA service's `DIDCommBridge`.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **DIDComm message expiry** — Outbound DIDComm messages now include
  `created_time` and `expires_time` fields, preventing stale messages
  from accumulating at the mediator between sessions. Expiry matches
  the caller's timeout (30 seconds for WebVH operations).
- **Problem-report logging** — Unhandled problem-report messages (e.g.,
  protocol-specific types from WebVH servers) now log `code`, `comment`,
  `from`, and `msg_type` instead of just "unknown message type". The
  standard problem-report handler also includes `msg_type` to
  distinguish between protocol-specific and standard problem reports.
- **Stale message detection** — The DIDComm bridge now logs unmatched
  responses (messages with a `thid` that don't match any pending
  request) at DEBUG level, identifying them as likely stale messages
  from a previous session.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **DIDComm outbound response routing** — The `DIDCommBridge` now
  correctly receives responses to outbound request-response messages
  (e.g., WebVH DID creation via DIDComm transport). Previously,
  `try_complete()` was never called on inbound messages, so
  `send_and_wait` would always time out.
- **Single mediator connection** — Replaced the dual-ATM architecture
  (one for the listener, one for the bridge) with a single shared
  connection. The new `BridgeHandler` wrapper captures the listener's
  ATM from `HandlerContext` and intercepts response messages before
  normal handler dispatch. This eliminates the
  `w.websocket.duplicate-channel` error loop that occurred when two
  connections used the same DID.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-04-11

### Client-Provided DID Documents for WebVH Creation

- **Three DID creation modes** — `POST /webvh/dids` now supports three
  mutually exclusive modes:
  - **VTA-built** (default) — VTA derives keys and builds the DID
    Document internally (existing behavior, unchanged).
  - **Template mode** (`did_document` field) — Client provides a DID
    Document template with `{DID}` placeholders. VTA derives keys,
    signs the log entry, and resolves placeholders via `didwebvh-rs`.
    `add_mediator_service` and `additional_services` are ignored.
  - **Final mode** (`did_log` field) — Client provides a complete,
    pre-signed `did.jsonl` log entry. VTA publishes it as-is without
    deriving keys or creating a log entry. No key records are stored.
- **`set_primary` flag** — Optional boolean (default `true`). When
  `false`, the context's primary DID (`ctx.did`) is not updated,
  allowing multiple DIDs per context without overwriting the primary.
- **CLI support** — `pnm webvh create-did` gains `--did-document <FILE>`,
  `--did-log <FILE>`, and `--no-primary` flags.
- **5 new integration tests** — Mutual exclusivity validation, template
  mode with custom keys, final mode storage, and `set_primary`
  true/false behavior.

### User-Specified Keys for DID Creation

- **`signing_key_id` / `ka_key_id` fields** — Optionally specify
  existing VTA-managed keys (imported or derived) for DID creation
  instead of having the VTA derive fresh keys. The signing key must
  be Ed25519; the KA key must be X25519.
- **Signing-only DIDs** — When only `signing_key_id` is provided, the
  DID Document is created with authentication/assertion but no
  keyAgreement, suitable for non-DIDComm use cases.
- **DIDComm validation** — If the DID Document includes
  `DIDCommMessaging` services (via `add_mediator_service`,
  `additional_services`, or a template), `ka_key_id` is required.
- **CLI support** — `pnm webvh create-did` gains `--signing-key` and
  `--ka-key` flags.
- **5 new integration tests** — Signing-only, both keys, KA-without-
  signing rejection, DIDComm-requires-KA, wrong key type rejection.

### Setup Wizard Improvements

- **Simple/advanced toggle** — VTA DID creation now offers a simple
  path (VTA creates everything) and an advanced path that reveals
  template mode, pre-signed log import, and user-specified key options.
- **Consolidated DID creation** — `did_webvh.rs` standalone CLI
  rewritten as a thin interactive wrapper around `operations::create_did_webvh()`,
  removing ~200 lines of duplicate key derivation and document building.
- **VTA DID via operations layer** — `create_vta_did()` in the setup
  wizard now uses `build_wizard_did()` → `operations::create_did_webvh()`
  instead of direct `didwebvh-rs` calls.
- **Pre-rotation UX** — Replaced interactive loop ("Generate another?")
  with a count prompt ("Number of pre-rotation keys", default: 1).
- **Post-creation hosting instructions** — After saving `did.jsonl`,
  the wizard now shows the URL where it should be uploaded.

### Capabilities Discovery

- **`GET /capabilities`** — New authenticated endpoint reporting VTA
  features (webvh, didcomm, tee, rest), enabled services, configured
  WebVH servers, and supported DID creation modes. Allows 3rd party
  apps using `vta-sdk` to probe what the VTA supports before attempting
  operations.
- **DIDComm discovery protocol** — `discover-capabilities` message type
  returns the same information via DIDComm.
- **`VtaClient::capabilities()`** — SDK client method for discovery.

### Infrastructure & Bug Fixes

- **Unified `build_did_document`** — merged `build_did_document` and
  `build_did_document_from_keys` into a single function with `include_ka`
  parameter.
- **DID deletion cleans up key records** — `delete_did_webvh` now removes
  associated signing, KA, and pre-rotation key records.
- **DIDComm bridge wired in handler path** — WebVH server communication
  via DIDComm now uses the real bridge instead of a dummy.
- **Pre-rotation keys in TEE autogen** — TEE auto-generated DIDs now
  include 1 pre-rotation key by default.
- **Mediator DID format validation** — Setup wizard validates `did:`
  prefix when entering an existing mediator DID.

### Code Consolidation

- **Eliminated `CreateDidRequest`** — REST route now uses
  `CreateDidWebvhBody` from SDK protocol types directly.
- **`From<CreateDidWebvhBody> for CreateDidWebvhParams`** —
  Centralizes default value logic, replacing boilerplate conversions
  in REST and DIDComm handlers.
- **Removed ~316 lines of duplicate code** — Deleted `create_webvh_did()`
  and `prompt_pre_rotation_keys()` from `setup.rs` after migrating
  all callers to `build_wizard_did()`.
- **Cleaned up unused imports** — Removed `didwebvh-rs` direct
  dependencies from `setup.rs` now that it uses the operations layer.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-01

### Reader Role & Action Classification

- **New `Reader` role** — Context-scoped read-only access to keys,
  contexts, DIDs, and configuration. Sits between Application and
  Monitor in the hierarchy. Readers can observe all business data
  within their allowed contexts but cannot sign, write to cache,
  create keys, or perform any mutating operation.
- **Action classification** — Every endpoint is now classified as
  read, write, or manage:
  - **Read** (Reader+): list/get keys, contexts, DIDs, config, cache
  - **Write** (Application+): sign, cache write/delete
  - **Admin**: key create/delete/import, seeds, audit, DID management
  - **Manage** (Initiator+): ACL operations, credential generation
  - **Super Admin**: config update, context CRUD, backup, restart
- **`require_read()` / `require_write()`** — New methods on
  `AuthClaims` for action-level authorization checks.
- **`WriteAuth` extractor** — Route-level extractor requiring at
  least Application role. Applied to sign and cache write endpoints.
- **Tightened auth on sign and cache** — `POST /keys/{id}/sign`,
  `PUT /cache/{key}`, and `DELETE /cache/{key}` now require
  Application role or higher (previously any authenticated user).
- **Backup export route** — Changed from `AuthClaims` to
  `SuperAdminAuth` extractor, matching the operations layer.
- **DIDComm handler auth fixes** — 17 handlers now have explicit
  role checks matching their REST counterparts (defense-in-depth).
  Fixed `handle_update_retention` from `require_admin()` to
  `require_super_admin()` to match REST.

### Role Hierarchy (updated)

```
Super Admin  (Admin + unrestricted)
  Admin      — key mgmt, DID ops, audit, seeds
    Initiator  — ACL management, credential generation
      Application — sign, cache write, standard API
        Reader     — read-only business data access
          Monitor  — metrics and health only
```

### Version Bumps

All crates bumped from 0.2.1 to **0.3.0**.

### Testing

- **18 new tests** — Reader role parsing, `require_read`/`require_write`
  enforcement across all roles, ACL validation (Reader cannot assign
  roles, Initiator/Admin can create Reader), integration tests (Reader
  can list keys, cannot sign, cannot create keys).
- **Total: 263 tests** (up from 245).

### VTA SDK Integration Module

- **`vta_sdk::integration::startup()`** — Unified startup pattern for
  any service that manages its DID and secrets through a VTA. Handles
  authentication, secret fetching, local caching, and offline fallback
  in a single call. Returns a `StartupResult` with the service DID,
  secrets bundle, source indicator, and an optional `VtaClient` for
  follow-up calls.
- **`SecretCache` trait** — Pluggable local cache for VTA secrets.
  Services implement `store()` and `load()` using their preferred
  backend (keyring, AWS Secrets Manager, filesystem, etc.) to enable
  offline resilience.
- **`authenticate()`** — Two-tier authentication strategy: lightweight
  REST auth first (`VtaClient::from_credential`), with session-based
  DIDComm fallback for non-`did:key` VTAs. Network errors propagate
  immediately without fallback.
- **`integration` feature flag** — New opt-in feature on `vta-sdk`
  (implies `client` + `session`) that enables the integration module.

### Key Labels as Verification Method IDs

- **`fetch_did_secrets_bundle()`** — When a key has a label, it is now
  used as the verification method fragment (e.g., `did:example#my-label`)
  instead of the raw key ID. This produces cleaner, human-readable DID
  documents for services that use labeled keys.

### Workspace Dependency Consolidation

- **`ed25519-dalek`** — Moved to `workspace.dependencies`, updated 6
  crates to use `workspace = true`.
- **`dialoguer`** — Moved to `workspace.dependencies`, updated 4
  crates to use `workspace = true`.
- **`chrono` in `vta-cli-common`** — Now uses workspace definition
  (gains `serde` feature that was previously missing).

### HTTP Client Improvements

- **`auth_light` client reuse** — `challenge_response_light()` and
  `refresh_token_light()` now accept a `&reqwest::Client` parameter
  instead of creating a new client per call, enabling connection
  pooling across authentication flows.
- **`authenticate_with_credential()`** — Returns the HTTP client
  alongside the auth result, which `VtaClient::from_credential()`
  now reuses directly (eliminating a redundant client allocation).
- **`WebvhClient` refactor** — Extracted `send()` and `with_auth()`
  helpers to eliminate repeated request/error-handling boilerplate
  across 4 methods.

### Code Quality

- **Zero clippy warnings** — Resolved all clippy warnings across the
  workspace: collapsible ifs, `.is_multiple_of()`, needless `Ok(?)`,
  `Default` impl for `WrappingKeyCache`, type alias for complex KMS
  return type.
- **`Keyspaces` struct** — New `operations::Keyspaces` bundles keyspace
  handles with `from_app_state()` and `from_vta_state()` constructors.
  Reduces argument counts for `export_backup` (11→6), `apply_import`
  (10→5), `delete_context` (8→5).
- **`DIDCommSendParams`** — New params struct for `send_and_wait_raw`,
  replacing 10 positional arguments.
- **`cargo fmt`** — Full workspace formatting pass.

### Security

- **VTC key material zeroization** — Added `zeroize` dependency to
  `vtc-service`. Replaced `.unwrap()` on key material slices with
  proper error propagation. Secrets bundle now written to file
  instead of stdout (preventing key leakage to logs).
- **Session error visibility** — Replaced `.ok()?` chains in keyring,
  file, and Azure session backends with explicit error logging via
  `tracing::warn`. Users can now diagnose auth failures from logs.

### Architecture

- **Shared `SeedStore` trait** — Extracted seed/secret store trait
  from `vta-service` into `vti-common/src/seed_store.rs`. Both VTA
  (`SeedStore`) and VTC (`SecretStore`) now implement the shared
  interface. Cloud backend implementations remain in each service crate.

### Testing

- **Operation-level unit tests** — New tests for `create_key` (Ed25519,
  P256), `sign_payload` (EdDSA roundtrip), and `rotate_seed` (archive
  + generation increment). Uses mock `SeedStore` and temp fjall stores.
- **Total: 245 tests** (up from 241).

### CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — Four
  parallel jobs: `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`,
  `cargo fmt --check`. Triggers on push to main/nightly and PRs to main.
  Cargo registry and target caching via `actions/cache`.

### Documentation

- **Integration Guide** (`docs/integration-guide.md`) — Comprehensive
  guide for 3rd-party developers integrating applications and services
  with the VTA. Covers credential provisioning, authentication patterns,
  key management, the SDK integration module, offline resilience, and
  security best practices.

---

## 0.3.0 — 2026-03-31

### Imported Secrets

- **Import external private keys** — New `POST /keys/import` endpoint
  and `pnm keys import` command allow importing externally-created
  private keys (Ed25519, X25519, P-256) into the VTA. Imported keys
  are stored encrypted at rest and participate in signing, secret
  export, backup/restore, and revocation alongside BIP-32-derived keys.
- **Ephemeral wrapping keys (REST)** — REST key import uses
  ECDH-ES + AES-256-GCM key wrapping via ephemeral X25519 keypairs
  (`GET /keys/import/wrapping-key`). Each wrapping key is single-use
  with a 60-second TTL. DIDComm transport sends keys directly inside
  the end-to-end encrypted envelope.
- **Encrypted storage layer** — Imported secrets are encrypted with
  AES-256-GCM using a KEK derived from the BIP-32 master seed via
  HKDF-SHA256 with a random 32-byte salt. Each ciphertext is bound
  to its `key_id:key_type` via authenticated associated data (AAD),
  preventing blob-swap attacks.
- **Secure deletion on revoke** — Revoking an imported key overwrites
  the encrypted blob with zeros and deletes it from the keyspace.
  The `KeyRecord` is retained for audit trail.
- **Seed rotation re-encryption** — When the BIP-32 seed is rotated,
  all imported secrets are automatically re-encrypted with the new
  seed-derived KEK.
- **Backup & restore** — Imported secrets are included in the
  encrypted backup payload (plaintext inside the Argon2id+AES-256-GCM
  envelope) and restored on import. The KEK salt is also backed up
  for deterministic KEK reconstruction.

### Data Model

- **`KeyOrigin` enum** — New `origin` field on `KeyRecord`:
  `derived` (default, BIP-32) or `imported` (external). Backward
  compatible via `#[serde(default)]`.
- **`ImportedSecretBackup`** — New type in `BackupPayload` for
  portable imported secret backup.
- **`imported_secret_count`** — Added to `ImportResult` for
  visibility during backup preview/import.

### Security

- **Zeroize** — All private key buffers are zeroized after use
  via the `zeroize` crate (import, signing, backup export/import,
  seed rotation re-encryption).
- **AAD binding** — AES-GCM encryption of imported secrets includes
  `key_id:key_type` as additional authenticated data, preventing
  ciphertext swapping between key entries.
- **Independent KEK salt** — A random 32-byte salt is generated
  per VTA instance and stored alongside the keyspace, ensuring
  two VTAs with the same seed produce different KEKs.
- **Admin-only import** — The import endpoint requires Admin role
  (stricter than key creation which allows Initiator).

### CLI

- **`pnm keys import`** — Import a private key from multibase
  string (`--private-key`) or file (`--private-key-file`).
  Supports `--key-type ed25519|x25519|p256`, `--label`, and
  `--context-id`. Prints a secure-deletion warning on success.

### Testing

- **6 new unit tests** — Imported secret encrypt/decrypt roundtrip,
  wrong-AAD rejection, secure deletion, seed rotation re-encryption,
  ephemeral wrapping key generation + unwrap, single-use enforcement.
- **Total: 234 tests** (up from 228).

### Breaking Changes

- **Operation signatures** — `get_key_secret()`, `sign_payload()`,
  `revoke_key()`, `rotate_seed()`, `export_backup()`, and
  `apply_import()` now accept an `imported_ks` parameter.
- **`AppState`** — Added `imported_ks: KeyspaceHandle` and
  `wrapping_cache: WrappingKeyCache` fields.
- **`VtaState` (DIDComm)** — Added `imported_ks: KeyspaceHandle`.
- **Workspace version bumped to 0.3.0** — All crates updated.

### Dependency Updates

- `hkdf` 0.12 (new — KEK derivation for imported secrets)

### VTA SDK Improvements for Service Integration

- **Lightweight DIDComm auth (`auth_light`)** — New
  `challenge_response_light()` and `refresh_token_light()`
  functions perform DIDComm challenge-response authentication
  without requiring ATM/TDK runtime initialization. Uses a
  hand-rolled JWE packer (`didcomm_light`) with
  ECDH-ES+A256KW key agreement and A256GCM content
  encryption. Available behind the `client` feature (not
  `session`).
- **`VtaClient::from_credential()`** — One-line constructor
  that decodes a base64 credential bundle, authenticates via
  lightweight auth, and returns a ready-to-use client with
  auto-refresh enabled.
- **Automatic token refresh** — `VtaClient` now stores
  credential material and automatically refreshes expired
  tokens before each API call. Tries the `/auth/refresh`
  endpoint first (cheap), falls back to full
  challenge-response if the refresh token is expired.
  Token expiry is checked with a 30-second buffer.
- **`fetch_context_secrets()`** — Convenience method that
  paginates through all active keys in a context and returns
  TDK `Secret` objects ready for DIDComm or signing. Pages
  in batches of 100 to handle large key sets.
- **`check_auth()`** — Verifies the current token is valid
  by calling `GET /health/details`. Returns `true`/`false`
  for readiness checks.
- **`token_expires_at()`** — Exposes token expiry for health
  monitoring in long-running services.
- **`set_token()` is now `&self`** — No longer requires
  `&mut self`, simplifying usage in shared contexts.

### Lightweight DIDComm Packer (`didcomm_light`)

- **DIDComm v2 anoncrypt** — Minimal JWE (General JSON)
  packer producing messages compatible with any DIDComm v2
  unpacker (including `affinidi-tdk`'s `ATM::unpack()`).
- **ECDH-ES+A256KW** key agreement with ephemeral X25519.
- **A256GCM** content encryption (simpler than A256CBC-HS512).
- **Concat KDF** (NIST SP 800-56A) for key derivation.
- **AES-256 Key Wrap** (RFC 3394) for CEK wrapping.
- **`did:key` → X25519** conversion (Edwards→Montgomery).
- **8 unit tests** — Key wrap roundtrip, KDF determinism,
  did:key parsing, Ed25519→X25519 conversion, JWE structure
  validation.

### VTA SDK Ergonomics

- **`vta_sdk::prelude`** — Re-exports the most commonly used
  types (`VtaClient`, `VtaError`, `KeyRecord`, `KeyType`,
  `CredentialBundle`, request/response types) for single-line
  imports.
- **Builder patterns** — `CreateKeyRequest::new(KeyType::Ed25519)
.label("my-key").context("app")` replaces verbose struct
  construction with many `None` fields. Builders added for
  `CreateKeyRequest`, `CreateContextRequest`, `CreateAclRequest`,
  and `GenerateCredentialsRequest`. All accept `impl Into<String>`.
- **`fetch_did_secrets_bundle()`** — One-call replacement for the
  4-step pattern (get context → list keys → get secrets → build
  bundle). Returns a portable `DidSecretsBundle`.
- **`From<GetKeySecretResponse> for SecretEntry`** — Eliminates
  manual field-by-field mapping when building secret bundles.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-03-30

### Bug Fixes

- **Health check deserialization** — Made `version` field optional
  in `vta-sdk::HealthResponse` so the unauthenticated `GET /health`
  endpoint (which returns only `{"status": "ok"}`) deserializes
  correctly. Previously `pnm health` and `cnm health` reported
  "error decoding response body".

### Improvements

- **Audit log levels** — Audit events now use `INFO` for successful
  outcomes and `ERROR` for failures (e.g. `denied:*`). Previously
  all audit events were emitted at `ERROR` level regardless of
  outcome.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-03-29

### Observability

- **Prometheus metrics endpoint** — `GET /metrics` serves
  request count and latency histograms in Prometheus text
  format. Requires authentication (any role including the
  new Monitor role).
- **Monitor role** — New lowest-privilege role for
  observability-only access. Can read `/metrics` and
  `/health` but nothing else. Create with
  `pnm acl create --role monitor`.

### Hardening

- **Admin credential delete-after-read** — The
  `/attestation/admin-credential` endpoint now deletes the
  credential from the store after first retrieval.
  Subsequent calls return 404.
- **Server-side backup password minimum** — The backup
  export API enforces a 12-character minimum password.
- **Super admin for backup/restart** — Backup export,
  import, and VTA restart now require super admin (admin
  with no context restrictions).
- **Enclave bootstrap error handling** — Replaced all
  `.expect()` calls in `vta-enclave/src/main.rs` with
  proper error handling and `tracing::error` before exit.
- **Clippy clean** — Fixed all actionable warnings:
  `Role::from_str` → `Role::parse`, `.clamp()`, needless
  borrows, collapsed ifs.

### Testing

- **31 REST API integration tests** — Full axum server
  with temp fjall store, programmatic JWT tokens, and
  pre-inserted sessions. Covers auth enforcement (6),
  role hierarchy (4), CRUD operations (5), backup (3),
  cache (1), audit (2), context scoping (1), key
  lifecycle (3), P-256 keys (1), seed list (1),
  wrong password (1), ACL lifecycle (1), context
  lifecycle (1), audit retention (1).
- **20 security-focused unit tests** — Auth role
  enforcement, ACL privilege escalation prevention,
  context access scoping, backup crypto validation.
- **Total: 226 tests** (up from 175 at start of release).

### Documentation

- **6 Mermaid diagrams** — Crate dependencies, REST vs
  DIDComm request flow, auth challenge-response sequence,
  BIP-32 derivation tree, TEE bootstrap sequence, enclave
  proxy architecture.
- **Consolidated docs** — Removed ~170 lines of
  duplicated content from README.md (feature flags, CLI
  reference). Cross-references to canonical sources.
- **Doc comments** on 35 public route handler functions.
- **Expanded CONTRIBUTING.md** — Development setup, test
  commands, PR checklist, coding guidelines.

### Architecture

- **vta-service / vta-enclave split** — `vta-service` is
  now a library crate exporting all business logic.
  `vta-enclave` is a separate binary crate for Nitro
  Enclave deployments with TEE-specific bootstrap (KMS,
  vsock-store, attestation). Future front-ends (SGX,
  serverless) follow the same pattern.
- **Soft restart** — The VTA server can now restart
  in-process without a process restart. Service threads
  shut down gracefully, auth/crypto re-initialize, and
  threads restart. Exposed via `POST /vta/restart`,
  DIDComm protocol, and `pnm vta restart`.
- **Patched affinidi-messaging-didcomm-service** — Local
  patch adds `tdk_config` field to `ListenerConfig` so
  the VTA can pass its network-mode DID resolver to the
  DIDComm service listener.

### TEE / Nitro Enclave

- **KMS-based secret bootstrap** — First boot generates
  BIP-39 seed and JWT key inside the enclave, encrypts
  with KMS `GenerateDataKey` (with Nitro attestation),
  stores ciphertext. Subsequent boots decrypt via KMS
  `Decrypt` with PCR enforcement.
- **Encrypted storage** — AES-256-GCM encryption of all
  sensitive keyspaces. Key derived from seed via HKDF.
- **Auto-generated VTA identity** — `did:webvh` DID
  created automatically on first boot from a template.
- **Admin credential bootstrap** — Operator-provided
  admin DID or auto-generated `did:key` with credential
  bundle stored for retrieval.
- **Seal mechanism** — Ed25519 challenge-response seal
  prevents offline CLI modification after bootstrap.
- **Nitro deployment infrastructure** — Dockerfile,
  enclave entrypoint, KMS setup scripts, IAM policies,
  full deployment guide (1,200+ lines).

### DIDComm

- **Migrated to affinidi-messaging-didcomm-service** —
  Replaced manual message dispatch with typed Router,
  handler functions, MessagePolicy middleware, and
  RequestLogging. Handlers use `Extension<Arc<VtaState>>`
  for shared state injection.
- **WebSocket-based DIDComm session** — PNM CLI now uses
  WebSocket streaming for response delivery, fixing
  reliability issues with REST-only polling.
- **Backup management protocol** —
  `backup-management/1.0/export` and
  `backup-management/1.0/import` DIDComm message types.
- **VTA restart protocol** —
  `vta-management/1.0/restart` DIDComm message type.

### P-256 Key Support

- **P-256 (secp256r1) key derivation** — New key type
  with BIP-32 derivation using domain-separated paths
  (`m/13'/256'/...`).
- **Signing oracle endpoint** — `POST /keys/{key_id}/sign`
  (REST) and `key-management/1.0/sign` (DIDComm) for
  server-side signing with managed keys.
- **Token cache API** — `GET/PUT/DELETE /cache/{key}` for
  ephemeral key-value storage with TTL support.

### Backup & Restore

- **Export** — `POST /backup/export` and DIDComm protocol
  serialize all VTA state (seed, keys, ACL, contexts,
  WebVH, config, optional audit logs) into a
  password-protected `.vtabak` file.
- **Encryption** — Argon2id (64 MiB, 3 iterations, 4
  parallel) derives AES-256-GCM key from user password.
- **Import** — `POST /backup/import` decrypts, validates,
  replaces all state, and triggers soft restart. Preview
  mode (`confirm=false`) shows what would change.
- **TEE re-encryption** — On import in TEE mode,
  `re_encrypt_bootstrap_secrets()` re-encrypts the
  imported seed and JWT key with the enclave's KMS key.
- **PNM CLI** — `pnm backup export [--include-audit]`
  and `pnm backup import <file> [--preview]`.

### Performance

- **DIDComm service DID resolver fix** — The DIDComm
  service listener was creating a local-mode DID resolver
  (ignoring network-mode config), causing ~1s of uncached
  HTTP DID resolution per message through the HTTPS proxy.
  Fixed via patched crate with `tdk_config` passthrough.
- **Reusable TrustPingSession** — PNM health command now
  creates one ATM + WebSocket connection for both mediator
  and VTA pings, eliminating ~4s of duplicate setup.
- **Shared DID resolver** — Single `DIDCacheClient` across
  all health check operations.

### CLI

- **DIDComm-only mode** — PNM CLI works without a REST
  URL, using DIDComm through the mediator for all
  operations.
- **Multi-VTA support** — `pnm vta list/use/remove/info`
  for managing connections to multiple VTAs.
- **`pnm vta restart`** — Trigger soft restart remotely.
- **`pnm backup export/import`** — Remote backup and
  restore with password protection.
- **Trust-ping in health** — `pnm health` now pings both
  the mediator and VTA through DIDComm with latency
  display.

### Enclave Proxy

- **Rust rewrite** — Replaced shell-based parent proxy
  with a Rust binary (`enclave-proxy`).
- **7-channel multiplexer** — Inbound REST, outbound
  mediator (TLS), HTTPS CONNECT proxy, IMDS credential
  proxy, persistent storage (fjall), DID resolver bridge,
  log forwarding.
- **Embedded Affinidi DID resolver** — Resolves mediator
  DID locally without external resolver service.
- **Connection limit** — Semaphore-based limit (256) per
  channel to prevent resource exhaustion.

### Breaking Changes

- **`vta-service` is now a library** — The local/dev
  binary is still included, but TEE deployments use
  `vta-enclave` which depends on `vta-service` as a
  library.
- **DIDComm handler signatures changed** — Handlers now
  use `(HandlerContext, Message, Extension<Arc<VtaState>>)`
  pattern from `affinidi-messaging-didcomm-service`.
- **Workspace version bumped to 0.2.0** — All crates
  updated.

### Dependency Updates

- `affinidi-messaging-didcomm-service` 0.1.2 (patched
  locally for TDK config passthrough)
- `didwebvh-rs` 0.3 → 0.4
- `tokio-vsock` 0.5 → 0.7
- `argon2` 0.5 (new — backup encryption)
- `aes-gcm` 0.10
- `hmac` 0.12

## 2026-03-21

### vti-common `0.1.1` (new crate)

- **Shared foundation crate** — Extracts common code
  from `vta-service` and `vtc-service` into a shared
  library: auth (JWT, sessions, extractors), ACL, error
  types, config types, and the fjall key-value store.
- **Key-only prefix scan** — New `prefix_keys()` method
  on `KeyspaceHandle` for efficient iteration when only
  keys are needed (no value decryption overhead).

### vta-service `0.1.3`

- **Audit logging system** — New structured audit log
  with persistence to fjall keyspace. Includes REST
  endpoints (`GET /audit/logs`, `GET /audit/retention`,
  `PATCH /audit/retention`) and DIDComm protocol
  support. Audit events emitted via tracing at the
  `audit` target and persisted for API retrieval.
- **Connection rate limiting** — Enclave proxy now
  enforces a configurable maximum concurrent connection
  limit (default 256) per proxy channel to prevent
  resource exhaustion.
- **Refactored to use vti-common** — Auth, ACL, store,
  error, and config modules now delegate to the shared
  `vti-common` crate, reducing duplication with
  `vtc-service`.
- **Code quality cleanup** — Eliminated unnecessary
  `KeyspaceHandle::clone()` calls in auth routes,
  combined redundant config lock acquisitions, removed
  duplicate `AuditLogQuery` struct in favor of SDK's
  `ListAuditLogsBody`, and optimized audit cleanup to
  use key-only iteration.

### vtc-service `0.1.2`

- **Refactored to use vti-common** — Auth, ACL, store,
  error, and config modules now delegate to the shared
  `vti-common` crate.

### vta-sdk `0.1.2`

- **Audit management protocol** — New
  `audit_management` module with types and client
  methods for listing audit logs
  (`list_audit_logs`), querying retention
  (`get_audit_retention`), and updating retention
  (`update_audit_retention`).

### vta-cli-common `0.1.2`

- **Audit commands** — New `cmd_list_audit_logs` (with
  colored table output), `cmd_get_retention`, and
  `cmd_update_retention` commands.
- **Simplified `cmd_list_audit_logs` API** — Accepts
  `&ListAuditLogsBody` directly instead of 8 individual
  parameters.

### pnm-cli `0.1.2`

- **`pnm audit list`** — List audit logs with filtering
  by time range, action, actor, outcome, and context.
- **`pnm audit retention get/set`** — View and update
  audit log retention period.

### Security Documentation

- **Security architecture** (`docs/security-architecture.md`)
  — Comprehensive security architecture document.
- **Threat model** (`docs/threat-model.md`) — Detailed
  threat model analysis.

## 2026-03-16

### vta-sdk `0.1.1`

- **Context provision bundle** — New
  `ContextProvisionBundle` type for encoding/decoding
  portable application onboarding bundles (context
  credentials, VTA config, and optional DID material).
- **Pluggable session storage (`SessionBackend` trait)**
  — `SessionStore` now uses a `SessionBackend` trait
  instead of compile-time feature flags. Consumers can
  provide their own storage implementation via
  `SessionStore::with_backend()`. Built-in backends
  (keyring, file, Azure) remain available as trait
  implementations.
- **DID log retrieval** — New `get_did_webvh_log()`
  client method and `GET_DID_WEBVH_LOG` protocol
  constant for retrieving stored DID logs.
- **Context deletion preview** — New
  `preview_delete_context()` and `delete_context()`
  client methods with cascading resource cleanup.
- **Serverless DID creation** —
  `CreateDidWebvhRequest` now supports an optional
  `url` field for serverless DID creation. Response
  includes `did_document` and `log_entry` for
  self-hosting.

### vta-service `0.1.2`

- **Serverless WebVH DID creation (`--did-url`)** —
  Create a DID document and log entry locally without
  a pre-registered WebVH server. Keys are derived and
  stored, and the DID document and log entry are
  returned for self-hosting.
- **Cascading context deletion** — Deleting a context
  removes all associated keys, WebVH DIDs (and logs),
  and cleans up ACL entries. A preview endpoint lets
  callers inspect what will be removed before
  committing.
- **DID log retrieval API** — New
  `GET /webvh/dids/{did}/log` endpoint (REST and
  DIDComm) to retrieve the stored DID log for a given
  WebVH DID.
- **Serverless DIDs now persist data** — Serverless
  DID creation stores the `WebvhDidRecord`, DID log,
  and updates the context DID field, matching
  server-managed behavior.
- **Upgraded to didwebvh-rs 0.3 `create_did()` API**
  — Replaced manual `DIDWebVHState` +
  `create_log_entry` + SCID/DID extraction with the
  high-level `CreateDIDConfig` builder and
  `create_did()`. DID documents now use `{DID}`
  placeholders.

### vta-cli-common `0.1.1`

- **`cmd_context_provision`** — Creates a context,
  generates admin credentials, and optionally creates
  a WebVH DID. Outputs a portable base64 bundle for
  application onboarding.
- **`cmd_context_reprovision`** — Regenerates a
  provision bundle for an existing context. Supports
  selecting an existing VTA-stored key interactively
  or via `--key`, or creating a new admin key.
  Includes full DID material (document, log entry,
  secrets).
- **`cmd_context_delete`** — Cascading delete with
  preview and interactive confirmation.
- **Serverless DID support** in
  `cmd_webvh_did_create` via `--did-url`.

### pnm-cli `0.1.1`

- **`pnm context provision`** — Single command for
  application onboarding with optional DID creation.
- **`pnm context reprovision`** — Regenerate provision
  bundles for existing contexts.
- **`pnm context delete`** — Cascading delete with
  preview and `--force` flag.
- **`pnm webvh create-did --did-url`** — Serverless
  DID creation.

### cnm-cli `0.1.1`

- **`cnm context delete`** — Cascading delete with
  preview and `--force` flag.

### vtc-service `0.1.1`

- **Upgraded to didwebvh-rs 0.3 `create_did()` API**
  — Same refactoring as vta-service for DID creation
  flows.

### Dependency Updates (all crates)

- `didwebvh-rs` 0.2 → 0.3
- `affinidi-tdk` 0.5 → 0.6
- `azure_security_keyvault_secrets` 0.11 → 0.12
- `azure_identity` 0.32 → 0.33
