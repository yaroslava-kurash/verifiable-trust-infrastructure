# VTC Legacy — ACL Collection

Placeholder Trust Task for the pre-MVP ACL collection endpoints
(list + create) inherited from the `vtc-service` skeleton. Two
HTTP methods share this task because they target the same
resource collection.

The shape of this Trust Task will be revised in M0.6+ when the
member-lifecycle endpoints land. The legacy ACL surface will
eventually be subsumed by `members/list/1.0` and the
provision-integration / passkey flows.
