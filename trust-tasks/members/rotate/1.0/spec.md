# VTC Members — DID Rotation

Step 2 of the two-step DID-rotation ceremony. Atomically
swaps the member's DID with both keys co-signing. Spec §10.5;
Phase 2 M2.15.1 ships `did:key` only; M2.15.2 layers in
`did:webvh` resolution.

## Authentication

Bearer-token JWT for the **old** DID's session. (The
milestone bullet says "new DID's session", but the new DID
has no ACL row yet — the standard `AuthClaims` extractor
wouldn't accept it. The body's `newSignature` field provides
the equivalent "new key holder is in control" guarantee. The
deviation is documented for M2.16's spec-clarification
pass.)

## Request

```
POST /v1/members/me/rotate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "rotationId": "<uuid from challenge>",
  "oldDid": "<caller's current DID>",
  "newDid": "<member's chosen new DID, must be did:key in M2.15.1>",
  "oldSignature": "<hex Ed25519 signature>",
  "newSignature": "<hex Ed25519 signature>"
}
```

Both signatures cover the same canonical payload bytes:

```
vtc-did-rotation/v1\0 || canonical_json({
  rotationId, oldDid, newDid, expiresAt
})
```

where `expiresAt` is the **epoch-seconds integer** from the
challenge response.

## Side-effects (all-or-nothing)

1. Consume the `rotation_id` (single-use).
2. Verify both signatures against the respective DID's
   Ed25519 pubkey.
3. Move the ACL row: delete `acl:<old>`, write `acl:<new>`
   with the same role + metadata.
4. Move the Member row (same DID transition).
5. Revoke every session keyed on the old DID.
6. Re-mint VMC + role VEC to the new DID, **reusing the
   existing status-list slot** (spec §6.2 — no new slot
   allocation on rotation).
7. Emit `DidRotated { oldDid, newDid, method, vmcId,
   roleVecId }` audit envelope. Actor is the **new** DID
   (future principal).

## Response (`200 OK`)

```
{
  "newDid": "<new DID>",
  "method": "did:key",
  "vmc": { ... freshly-signed VMC ... },
  "roleVec": { ... freshly-signed VEC ... }
}
```

## Errors

- `400 Bad Request` — DID method unsupported (currently any
  non-`did:key` value), `rotationId` not found / expired /
  already consumed, malformed signatures, same-DID
  rotation, signature verification failure.
- `401 Unauthorized` — missing / invalid session token.
- `403 Forbidden` — session DID doesn't match `oldDid`, or
  the rotation challenge was issued for a different DID.
- `409 Conflict` — `newDid` already has an ACL row.

## Notes

- `did:webvh` rotation (M2.15.2) extends this endpoint by
  detecting the method and walking the `did.jsonl` log via
  `affinidi-did-resolver-cache-sdk` to verify the prior-key
  signature on the latest log entry. Until that lands,
  non-`did:key` new-DID values are 400'd with a pointer to
  the follow-up milestone.
