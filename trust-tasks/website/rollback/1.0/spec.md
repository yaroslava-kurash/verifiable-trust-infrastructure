# VTC — Website generation rollback

Phase 5 M5.5.4. Admin-gated. Managed mode only. Flips the `current` symlink to the requested past generation via the `symlink + rename` atomic-swap idiom. Rollback to the currently-active generation is a 200 no-op. Emits `WebsiteGenerationRolledBack` audit envelope on success.
