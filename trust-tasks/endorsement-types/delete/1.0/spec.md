# VTC — Endorsement Type Delete

## Semantics

- **Auth**: Admin role.
- Refuses with `409 endorsement-type-in-use` while at least one live endorsement of the type still exists. Operators must revoke all live endorsements first.
- `404` when the type isn't registered.
- Emits `EndorsementTypeDeleted { typeUri }`.

## Outputs

`200 OK` with `{ typeUri }`.

## Status

Draft.
