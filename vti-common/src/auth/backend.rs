//! Canonical auth-flow backend trait.
//!
//! Five callers (VTA, VTC, did-hosting-control, did-hosting-server,
//! did-hosting-witness) all run the same shape of `/auth/challenge`,
//! `/auth/authenticate`, `/auth/refresh` flow with minor policy
//! differences (TEE attestation, DID-method allowlist, per-DID
//! rate limit) and different storage / error / role types.
//!
//! [`AuthBackend`] is the boundary that lets the canonical handlers
//! in [`crate::auth::handlers`] run unchanged across all five
//! services. Each service implements `AuthBackend` once; the
//! per-route boilerplate collapses to "build the input, call the
//! handler, map the response."
//!
//! ## Trait shape
//!
//! - Associated [`Store`](AuthBackend::Store) — the session storage
//!   primitives the handler needs. Implementors typically wrap their
//!   keyspace handle in a thin adapter that implements
//!   [`SessionStore`].
//! - Associated [`Error`](AuthBackend::Error) — the backend's own
//!   error type. Must convert from [`AuthError`] so the canonical
//!   handler can raise the auth-specific failures and the route
//!   layer surfaces them via its existing `IntoResponse` plumbing.
//! - Associated [`Role`](AuthBackend::Role) — the backend's role
//!   enum (vti-common's `Role`, did-hosting's `Role`, etc.). The
//!   handler treats it opaquely; it appears in the JWT minter
//!   contract and the audit log only.
//! - Default-method policy hooks — [`validate_did`], [`attest_challenge`],
//!   [`max_pending_challenges_per_did`], [`audit`] — backends override
//!   only when they need non-default behaviour. Most backends override
//!   one or two; the rest inherit safe defaults.
//!
//! ## What stays out of the trait
//!
//! - Transport (REST vs. DIDComm) — the canonical handler takes a
//!   pre-extracted [`AuthInput`] struct; transport-specific unpacking
//!   stays in the route handler.
//! - JWT structure — `JwtKeys` is the same across all callers; the
//!   handler holds a `&JwtKeys` reference and mints directly.
//! - Wire-shape serialisation — canonical request / response types
//!   live in `vta_sdk::protocols::auth` and are shared with clients.
