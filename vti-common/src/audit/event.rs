//! [`AuditEvent`] — the tagged enum of every audit-log variant.
//!
//! Ships the **Phase-0 vocabulary** matching spec §11.4. Phase-1+
//! variants land alongside their owning features (join requests,
//! members, policies, registry, VRC, etc.) and follow the same
//! pattern: one variant per semantically distinct event, with a
//! purpose-built data struct.
//!
//! ## Wire contract
//!
//! - Tagged form `#[serde(tag = "type", content = "data")]` so
//!   external consumers (SIEM, later webhooks) discriminate on the
//!   `type` field. **Variant identifiers are part of the wire
//!   contract — don't rename them without bumping
//!   `EVENT_VERSION`.**
//! - Data structs use `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` for
//!   downstream tooling friendliness. Field names are also wire
//!   contract.
//!
//! ## Sensitive-field redaction
//!
//! [`ConfigChange::redact_if`] walks a [`ConfigChangedData`] and
//! masks `old_value` / `new_value` for any key matched by the caller-
//! supplied sensitivity predicate. The emitter (config endpoint
//! handlers, M0.8) calls this **before** persisting the event so
//! sensitive values never reach the audit keyspace in cleartext.
