# Community lifecycle

How a member joins, what credentials they receive, how they
maintain membership, and how they leave. The lifecycle is driven
by **Rego policies**: the VTC ships defaults that default-deny, and
operators upload site-specific policies to actually admit anyone.

## Lifecycle states

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Applying : POST /v1/join-requests
    Applying --> Rejected : policy denies / admin rejects
    Applying --> Member : policy + admin approval
    Member --> Renewed : POST /v1/members/me/renew
    Renewed --> Member
    Member --> Rotated : POST /v1/members/me/rotate
    Rotated --> Member
    Member --> Suspended : status-list flip<br/>(admin)
    Suspended --> Member : status-list unflip
    Member --> Departed : self-remove / admin-remove
    Departed --> [*] : tombstone or purge
    Rejected --> [*]
```

The VTC tracks every state transition in the audit log
(`AuditEvent::MemberAdded` / `MemberUpdated` / `MemberRemoved` /
`StatusListFlipped` / `MembershipRenewed` / `DidRotated` / …).

## Policies that gate the lifecycle

| Policy | Trigger | Default | Where to author |
|---|---|---|---|
| `join.rego` | `POST /v1/join-requests` | deny-all | `cnm policies upload --purpose join` |
| `removal.rego` | `DELETE /v1/members/{did}` | deny-all | `cnm policies upload --purpose removal` |
| `personhood.rego` | `POST /v1/members/{did}/personhood/assert` | allow if VP carries a `WitnessCredential` (Phase 4 default) | `cnm policies upload --purpose personhood` |
| `relationships.rego` | `POST /v1/relationships` | allow if both parties are current members | `cnm policies upload --purpose relationships` |
| `registry.rego` | `MembershipSyncer` reconciliation | `publish_on_join: true; default_departure: tombstone` | `cnm policies upload --purpose registry` |
| `cross_community_roles.rego` | `POST /v1/auth/recognise` | deny-all (no peer recognition) | `cnm policies upload --purpose cross-community-roles` |

Each policy gets a canonical input shape supplied by the VTC. See
the VTC spec [§8](../05-design-notes/vtc-mvp.md) for the full input
schemas.

## Join flow (happy path)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Prospective member
    participant VTC as VTC
    participant Admin as Admin
    participant TR as Trust Registry

    M->>M: Assemble evidence VPs<br/>(WitnessCredential, etc.)
    M->>VTC: POST /v1/join-requests<br/>(VP-framed)
    VTC->>VTC: Verify VP signatures
    VTC->>VTC: Evaluate active join.rego
    alt policy denies
        VTC-->>M: 403 + rule failure reason
    else policy admits
        VTC->>VTC: Persist join request
        VTC->>Admin: (notification surface — Phase 6+)
        Admin->>VTC: cnm join approve <id>
        VTC->>VTC: Allocate status-list slot
        VTC->>VTC: Insert ACL entry (role=Member)
        VTC->>VTC: Mint VMC + status-list credential
        VTC->>TR: Publish membership<br/>(via MembershipSyncer)
        VTC-->>M: Sealed credential bundle
    end
```

Both ends use VP/VC envelopes throughout — there is no
bespoke-JSON authorisation format. The credential bundle the member
receives is HPKE-sealed to their `did:key` (the same sealed-transfer
envelope every VTI bootstrap uses).

## Removal dispositions

When a member leaves (self-remove or admin-remove), the operator
chooses one of three dispositions. The choice surfaces in the
trust-registry record so peer communities see the same intent:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    leave([Member departure])
    purge["Purge<br/>(RTBF)"]
    tomb[Tombstone]
    hist[Historical]

    leave --> purge
    leave --> tomb
    leave --> hist

    purge -->|wipes PII<br/>blanks DID| audit_purge[Audit: rtbf=true]
    tomb -->|keeps row<br/>marks tombstoned| audit_tomb[Audit: tombstone]
    hist -->|keeps row<br/>marks departed| audit_hist[Audit: historical]

    audit_purge --> registry1[Trust registry<br/>refresh]
    audit_tomb --> registry1
    audit_hist --> registry1
```

- **Purge** — RTBF (right-to-be-forgotten). The member row's PII
  is wiped; the row becomes a tombstone with `purged: true`. The
  trust-registry record is removed (batched per
  `registry.rtbf_batch_window_hours` to break timing correlation).
- **Tombstone** — the member row stays but is marked
  `tombstoned: true`. PII fields stay; further authentication
  fails.
- **Historical** — the member row stays editable for audit /
  historical research. The status-list slot still flips (revoked).

The active `registry.rego` determines which dispositions are
permitted (`removal_options` field) and the default
(`default_departure`). A self-initiated `Purge` always overrides
`min_disposition` (RTBF cannot be downgraded by community policy).

## VMC / VEC lifecycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    join([Member joins]) --> mint[Mint VMC<br/>+ optional VEC]
    mint --> live[Live<br/>not revoked]
    live -->|renew| live2[New VMC<br/>fresh validUntil<br/>same slot]
    live -->|rotate DID| live
    live -->|suspend| sus[Suspended<br/>StatusList bit 1]
    sus -->|unsuspend| live
    live -->|admin-remove<br/>or self-remove| rev[Revoked<br/>StatusList bit 1 forever]
    rev --> tomb_purge[Tombstone /<br/>purged]
    live2 --> live

    classDef good fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#3e8e41,color:#1b3a1f
    classDef bad fill:#ffebee,stroke:#c62828,color:#5a0303
    class live,live2 good
    class sus,rev,tomb_purge bad
```

- **VMC** = Verifiable Membership Credential. Mandatory for every
  member; `validUntil` is bounded (default 30 days, configurable).
  Inside the community the ACL is authoritative — an expired VMC
  doesn't lock the member out, they just renew via
  `POST /v1/members/me/renew`.
- **VEC** = Verifiable Endorsement Credential. Optional. Adds a
  role or attribute claim (Issuer, Moderator, custom endorsement
  type).
- **VRC** = Verifiable Relationship Credential. Self-issued by
  members to declare trust edges to other members (see
  [`personhood-and-graph.md`](personhood-and-graph.md)).

Each credential has its own slot on the shared BitstringStatusList.
Revocation flips the bit; the public list is served at
`GET /v1/status-lists/{purpose}` so external verifiers can check
without authenticating.

## Renewal failure modes

`POST /v1/members/me/renew` re-evaluates `personhood.rego` against
the member's current evidence. The operator-configured
`renewal.on_personhood_fail` (Phase 4 D5) decides what happens when
the policy returns `false` for a member whose previous
`personhood` flag was `true`:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `downgrade` (default) | Flip `personhood = false`, re-mint VMC without the flag, audit `PersonhoodRevoked { reason: "renewal-policy" }`, return success. |
| `refuse` | Reject renewal with 403. The member keeps the *old* VMC until they re-present evidence sufficient to pass `personhood.rego`. |

## DID rotation

Members can rotate the DID they authenticate with via a
two-step ceremony:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Old as Member (old DID)
    participant New as Member (new DID)
    participant VTC as VTC

    Old->>VTC: POST /v1/members/me/rotate/challenge
    VTC-->>Old: rotation_id + nonce
    Old->>New: Hand over rotation_id (out-of-band)
    Old->>VTC: POST /v1/members/me/rotate<br/>(co-signed envelope)
    New->>VTC: (also co-signed)
    Note over VTC: Verify both signatures<br/>against rotation_id
    VTC->>VTC: Swap ACL row<br/>Re-mint VMC for new DID<br/>Audit DidRotated
    VTC-->>Old: 200 + new credential bundle
```

Both the old and new DID sign the rotation request. The VTC
preserves the member's status-list slot — the same audit identity
moves to the new DID. `did:key` and `did:webvh` are both supported;
for `did:webvh` rotations the VTC resolves the new DID document
and verifies the signing key against it.
