# Spec: Verifiable Trust Community (VTC) — MVP

Status: **Draft**
Owner: Glenn Gore
Last updated: 2026-05-11

## 1. Objective

Turn the skeletal `vtc-service` crate (auth, ACL, sessions, DIDComm,
setup, `did:webvh`) into a minimum-viable **Verifiable Trust
Community** — a self-governing community service that sits on top of
an existing VTA, manages members through policy-driven join/leave,
issues DTG credentials, integrates with a trust-registry, and
optionally hosts a public website. The admin web UX lives in a
separate sibling repo and consumes the REST API.

**Non-goals (MVP)**

- Multi-tenant VTC. One binary, one community.
- Custom credential types. Strictly the DTG catalog (§6.1).
- TEE deployment of the VTC. *Permanent* non-goal (§3).
- N-of-M admin approvals; webhooks; bulk ops; WASM plugins; i18n at
  the resource layer. Defensible retrofits (§18).

## 2. Dependencies

Rust workspace, edition 2024, MSRV 1.94.0.

Internal: `vti-common`, `vta-sdk` (REST + DIDComm + sealed-transfer),
`affinidi-messaging-didcomm-service`, `fjall`, `axum`.

New external:

- [`dtg-credentials`](https://github.com/OpenVTC/dtg-credentials) —
  the closed credential catalog.
- [`affinidi-trust-registry-rs`](https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-trust-registry-rs)
  — TRQP v2.0 client.
- [`affinidi-status-list`](https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-tdk-rs)
  — W3C Bitstring Status List v1.0.
- `regorus` — embedded Rego engine.
- `webauthn-rs` — passkey enrolment.

## 3. Pinned architectural decisions

Single source of truth. Downstream sections cite §3 by row letter and
do not restate.

| | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | **1 VTC ⇄ 1 VTA**; **VTA mints + controls keys, VTC caches + signs locally** | The VTA is the canonical issuer of the integration DID's keys: it mints them at first-boot via the existing provision-integration flow and remains the only party authorised to mint or rotate them. The VTC retains a cached working copy of those keys in its own secret store (mediator / webvh-service pattern) and signs locally — every VMC, VEC, status-list credential, install-token JWT, and DIDComm outbound message is signed in-process. "No key custody" in earlier drafts meant "no key minting / rotation authority", not "no key storage" — clarified per Phase 2 M2.16. |
| **B** | **VTC is always authoritative for its own state** | ACL + keyspaces are truth. VMC/VEC are *projections* useful only when the member operates outside the VTC. VTC authz never reads its own issued VCs. |
| **C** | **Credentials limited to the DTG catalog** | New credential needs go upstream into `dtg-credentials`, not local extensions. |
| **D** | **Embedded `regorus`, no OPA sidecar** | Single artefact, lower latency. Policy activation is explicit; no hot-reload watchers. |
| **E** | **Trust-registry and StatusList are complementary** | StatusList = "is this VC revoked?"; trust-registry = "is this entity an active member?". Robust verifiers consult both. |
| **F** | **VMC `validUntil` is mandatory, finite, configurable** (default 30d) | External verifiers MUST see a bounded VMC. Inside the community, ACL is authoritative — expired VMC does not lock the member out (membership renewal is unconditional on ACL membership; see §6.3). |
| **G** | **Admin UX is a separate sibling repo** | VTC ships pure backend; admin UX consumed as a release artefact (§12.2). |
| **H** | **Public website is feature-gated and filesystem-backed** | Operators can disable to host externally, or update files in place via standard tools (§12.1). |
| **I** | **Extensibility = Rego + opaque JSON blobs** | Communities customise behaviour via policies and data via `extensions: JsonValue` slots. No plugin loader. |
| **J** | **Hygiene from day one** | Versioned audit events with HMAC-hashed actors, idempotency keys, `/v1/` URL prefix, cursor pagination, multi-passkey-per-admin. Retrofits are painful. |
| **K** | **VTC never targets TEE deployment** | *Permanent* non-goal. Trust anchor for TEE remains the VTA. |
| **L** | **Every wire op is a registered Trust Task** | REST endpoints and DIDComm messages bind to a versioned Trust Task on [trusttasks.org](https://trusttasks.org). Soft gate for MVP — stable IDs + Draft `spec.md` required before an endpoint ships (§9.4). |
| **M** | **`extensions: JsonValue` is the universal extensibility slot** | Present on `CommunityProfile`, `Member`, `JoinRequest`, `AdminEntry`, audit envelopes. Opaque to the VTC. Validated only for size and JSON well-formedness. Communities own its shape. |

## 4. Bootstrap & install

### 4.1 CLI wizard — minimal handoff to web UX

`vtc setup` is a five-prompt interactive wizard that provisions
the VTC's identity against a running VTA and prints the one-shot
install URL the operator uses to claim their admin passkey.

**Amended 2026-05-12.** This section was originally specified as
a three-prompt wizard that minted a local BIP-39 seed; that
contradicted §4.5's recovery model and was reworked under
`tasks/vtc-mvp/vta-driven-keys.md` §3. The VTA is now the sole
key authority — there is no locally-held mnemonic anywhere.

Prompts:

1. Config path (default `config.toml`).
2. VTC URL (e.g. `https://vtc.example.com/v1`).
3. Admin UX URL (e.g. `https://admin.vtc.example.com`).
4. VTA URL (e.g. `https://vta.example.com`).
5. VTA DID (e.g. `did:webvh:vta.example.com:abc`).
6. Context name at the VTA for this community.

(Plus the secrets-backend prompt for `keyring` / `aws` / `gcp` /
`azure` / `inline` / `plaintext`, surfaced via the shared
`vti_common::setup::secrets_prompt` helper.)

Flow:

1. Mint an ephemeral Ed25519 `did:key` used only for the
   round-trip.
2. Print the ephemeral DID and pause. The operator runs
   `pnm acl create --did <…> --role admin --contexts <ctx>
   --expires 1h` against the VTA to authorize the ephemeral
   DID, then presses Enter.
3. Drive `vta_sdk::provision_client::run_provision` with
   `VtaIntent::FullSetup` and `ProvisionAsk::for_template
   ("vtc-host", { URL, ADMIN_UX_URL }, ctx)`.
4. Open the returned sealed bundle. Extract the integration
   DID + its `DidKeyMaterial` (Ed25519 + X25519) into a
   `VtcKeyBundle`; write to the chosen secret-store backend.
5. Write the `did.jsonl` log from
   `TemplateBootstrapPayload.config.outputs` to
   `<store.data_dir>/did/<scid>.jsonl`. The daemon publishes
   it at `GET /v1/{scid}/did.jsonl` (Trust-Task-exempt).
6. Write `config.toml` (`vtc_did`, `vta_did`, `public_url`,
   `store`, `secrets`, `auth.jwt_signing_key`).
7. Initialise all fjall keyspaces (§13).
8. Mint a single-use **install token** (signed JWT, 15-minute
   TTL, with a one-time WebAuthn ceremony nonce embedded).
9. Print the install URL. The operator runs `vtc` to start
   the daemon.

**Install token transport hardening.** The install URL is printed
once to the operator's terminal. The token alone is *insufficient*
to claim admin — `POST /v1/install/claim` requires a WebAuthn
ceremony bound to the embedded nonce. Stolen tokens cannot be
claimed without the operator's authenticator.

### 4.2 Web install flow

Admin UX opens the URL, then:

1. **Claim** — `POST /v1/install/claim` with the WebAuthn challenge
   response. VTC verifies the ceremony, the embedded nonce, and the
   token's single-use carve-out (gated by a process-wide async
   mutex; mirrors VTA's `MODE_B_LOCK` invariant — concurrent claims
   are impossible). Carve-out closes atomically on first success.
2. **Passkey ↔ DID binding.** WebAuthn enrolment is restricted to
   Ed25519 (`COSEAlgorithmIdentifier = -8 EdDSA`) so the passkey
   public key can be projected into a `did:key` directly. Operators
   whose authenticators don't support Ed25519 see an install error
   pointing at supported devices. The admin's DID is `did:key:<...>`
   derived from the WebAuthn credential's public key, and the
   install ceremony also requires the candidate DID to sign a server-
   issued challenge — proving both the passkey and the DID-signing
   path operate over the same keypair.
3. **Profile + policies** — operator enters community profile, picks
   a seed policy template, configures trust-registry behaviour.
4. **Bootstrap** — `POST /v1/admin/bootstrap` writes the first ACL
   entry (`role: Admin`) and emits `CommunityInstalled`.

After bootstrap the install URL is dead.

### 4.3 Multi-passkey per admin DID

Admin entries carry `passkeys: Vec<RegisteredPasskey>` from day one.
Each passkey records `credential_id`, `public_key`, `transports`,
`label`, `registered_at`, `last_used_at`.

Endpoints:

- `POST /v1/admin/passkeys/register` — enrol an additional device.
- `DELETE /v1/admin/passkeys/{credential_id}` — revoke a device.
- `GET /v1/admin/passkeys` — list.

**Reauth invariant.** Passkey enrolment and revocation **require a
fresh WebAuthn user-verification ceremony in the same request** (not
just a valid session). A stolen session cannot persist by binding a
new authenticator. The user-verification flag in the WebAuthn
assertion must be `true`.

**Concurrency invariant.** Passkey writes serialise per admin DID
under a fjall compare-and-set. The "refuses to leave zero passkeys"
check executes inside the same transaction.

**REST-only.** Passkey ceremonies are origin-bound by the browser.
The corresponding DIDComm protocol is **not** provided — passkey
registration over DIDComm would bypass WebAuthn's RP-ID enforcement
and is explicitly forbidden.

### 4.4 The `vtc-host` DID template

Built-in template in `vta-sdk::did_templates::builtin`. Required
var: `URL` (no trailing slash). Optional: `STATUS_LIST_PATH`
(default `/v1/status-lists`).

Mints two keys, following the workspace convention used by every
other built-in template:

- **`#key-0`** Ed25519 — `assertionMethod` + `authentication` (one
  signing key serves both purposes; matches `webvh-control` and
  friends).
- **`#key-1`** X25519 — `keyAgreement` (sealed-transfer + later
  DIDComm reception).

Service entries: `#vtc-rest` (`type: VTCRest`, endpoint = `{URL}`),
`#vtc-status-list` (`type: VTCStatusList`, endpoint =
`{URL}{STATUS_LIST_PATH}`). The status-list endpoint is gracefully
present from day one so external verifiers can pre-cache resolution;
the actual BitstringStatusList credentials are populated in Phase 2.

DIDComm is not advertised by default — communities that need a
mediator add it later via the existing runtime-service-management
flow.

### 4.5 Emergency bootstrap (recovery)

If every admin passkey is lost: `vtc admin emergency-bootstrap` on
a stopped daemon clears the local admin state and reopens the
install carve-out, **gated on the operator's continued ability to
authenticate as an admin against the VTA**.

**Amended 2026-05-12.** This section originally specified a
mnemonic-gated recovery path; that was incompatible with §4.1's
revised VTA-as-key-authority model (the VTA's `provision-integration`
returns random integration keys that no BIP-39 mnemonic decodes
to). Reworked under `tasks/vtc-mvp/vta-driven-keys.md` §4.

Flow:

1. Operator stops the daemon and runs
   `vtc admin emergency-bootstrap [--context <ctx>]`.
2. The command mints a fresh ephemeral Ed25519 `did:key` and
   prints the `pnm acl create` command needed to authorize it
   at the VTA. The operator runs that against PNM (or any
   equivalent VTA admin tool they hold credentials for) and
   presses Enter.
3. The driver calls
   `vta_sdk::provision_client::run_provision(VtaIntent::AdminRotated,
   ProvisionAsk::vta_admin_rotated(ctx))`. The VTA's accept
   IS the recovery authority: if the ephemeral DID was just
   granted admin role in `ctx`, the call succeeds.
4. On VTA accept: locally clear every `Role::Admin` ACL entry,
   every `admin:<did>` sister record, every PasskeyUser /
   credential mapping for those admins; reopen the install
   carve-out; mint a fresh single-use install URL; persist a
   one-shot `install:emergency_pending` marker so the daemon's
   next boot emits an `EmergencyBootstrapInvoked` audit
   envelope (operator hostname + timestamp).
5. On VTA reject (`AppError::Unauthorized`): no local state is
   touched. The recovery either re-runs after a successful
   `pnm acl create`, or the operator has lost admin access at
   the VTA too — at which point the community is lost (by
   design; there is one trust root, not two).

**What persists**: the community profile (§5.1), the audit log
(emergency bootstrap is itself audited), and the `VtcKeyBundle`
(the VTC's integration DID + keys stay put — only the admin ACL
state resets).

**Trust boundary**: a filesystem-level attacker who stops the
process and runs this command still has to clear the VTA's
`provision-integration` check. Possession of the VTC's data
directory is not sufficient.

Documented as a destructive operator action with a loud audit
trail.

## 5. Domain model

### 5.1 `CommunityProfile` (singleton, key `community/profile`)

Fields: `community_did` (immutable), `name`, `description`,
`logo_url`, `public_url`, `contact_email`, `language` (BCP 47,
default `"en"`), `created_at`, `extensions` (§3-M).

### 5.2 `Member`

```
did, role, joined_at, status_list_index, publish_consent,
departure_preference, current_vmc_id, current_role_vec_id, extensions
```

Admin entries additionally carry `passkeys: Vec<RegisteredPasskey>`
(§4.3).

### 5.3 `Role`

```
enum VtcRole { Admin, Moderator, Issuer, Member, Custom(String) }
```

Default permission matrix for **standard roles**:

| Action | Admin | Mod | Issuer | Member |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Edit community profile | ✓ | | | |
| Author / activate policies | ✓ | | | |
| Approve / reject join requests | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| Issue VEC / VWC / RCard on behalf of community | ✓ | | ✓ | |
| Issue VMC | (only via join flow) | | | |
| Promote to Admin | ✓ (§10.4) | | | |
| Remove other members | ✓ | ✓ (policy-gated) | | |
| Self-remove | ✓ (§10.2) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Renew own VMC | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Publish self-issued VRC | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Rotate own DID | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Custom roles**: `Role::Custom(String)` receives *no* implicit
grants from the matrix. The only authoritative source of Custom-role
permissions is `role_definitions.rego` (§7.1). Unspecified actions
default-deny. The standard matrix above applies *only* to the four
named roles; do not bridge it onto Custom roles by similarity.

### 5.4 `Policy`

Rego module + metadata (`id`, `name`, `purpose`, `rego_source`,
`compiled` bytecode, `sha256`, `activated_at`, `author_did`). Exactly
one policy per `purpose` is active. Activating a new policy
atomically supersedes the prior one; the prior is retained as
archived.

### 5.5 `JoinRequest`

```
id, applicant_did, vp, submitted_at, status,
policy_decision, registry_consent, extensions
```

`status ∈ { Pending, Approved, Rejected, Withdrawn, Deferred }`.
Rejected and withdrawn requests retained for 30 days (configurable
via `join_requests.retention_days`), then purged by the retention
sweeper. VP contents may include PII — the retention window is the
sole control.

### 5.6 `StatusListState`

```
purpose ∈ { Revocation, Suspension }
capacity (default 2^17 = 131_072)
next_random_seed
occupied
list_credential_id
```

### 5.7 `RegistryRecord`

```
record_id, member_did, status ∈ { Active, Departed },
active_from, active_to, last_synced_at
```

## 6. Credentials — DTG catalog

### 6.1 Mapping

| Use | Type | Issuer | Subject | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Membership | **VMC** | community DID | member DID | `personhood: bool` gated by §6.4. `validUntil` mandatory (§3-F). |
| Role grant | **VEC** | community DID | member DID | `endorsement = { type: "CommunityRole", role, communityDid }`. Re-issued on role change. |
| Invitation | **VIC** | community DID (admin/issuer) | applicant DID | Required by gated communities' join policies. |
| Member ↔ member trust edge | **VRC** | member DID | other member DID | Self-issued, optionally published (§12.3). |
| Member contact card | **RCard** | member or community | member | jCard value. |
| Event/proximity witness | **VWC** | external | applicant | Consumed in join VPs; VTC does not issue. |
| Custom endorsement (badges, attestations) | **VEC** | community (issuer role) | any DID | Community-defined `endorsement` value. The hook for "we don't invent credential types". |
| Persona | VPC | community | member | **v2**. Not in MVP. |

### 6.2 Status list

- VTC mints two `BitstringStatusListCredential`s on install
  (revocation + suspension), capacity 131K each. Hosted under the
  `#vtc-status-list` service entry on the VTC DID — not the
  deployment URL — so a host migration does not break issued VMCs.
- Every VMC carries `credentialStatus` referencing the appropriate
  list and index.
- **Index allocation is random with decoys** (affinidi-status-list's
  privacy mode).
- **Flipped indices are never reallocated.** Once a member departs
  and their bit is flipped (revoked or suspended), the index is
  permanently reserved as a decoy. Allocating it to a new member
  would let external verifiers correlate the new member's slot with
  the departed identity. Index space is sized accordingly.
- Telemetry emits `StatusListOccupancyWarning` at 75% (live +
  reserved). Chaining is v2 (§17).

### 6.3 Renewal — unconditional on ACL membership

`POST /v1/members/me/renew`. Auth check verifies the caller's
session matches an active ACL entry. **No expiry check, no grace
window.** Per §3-F, VMC validity is an external-verifier concern;
inside the community, ACL is truth.

Issuance steps:

1. Mint new VMC (`validFrom = now`, `validUntil = now + community.membership.validity`)
   via the VTC's local signer (§3-A — cached integration-DID keys).
   Same status-list index.
2. Re-issue role VEC (always — both for ACL/role drift and to keep
   external chains current).
3. Re-evaluate `personhood.rego` (§6.4) and surface the resulting
   `personhood` flag on the new VMC. If the flag changes from the
   prior VMC, the audit event `MembershipRenewed` records
   `personhood_changed: true`.
4. Sealed-transfer to member's DID.

### 6.4 Personhood

`personhood.rego` ships as a **deny-all stub**. Community admins
author the actual rule. Personhood is asserted via a dedicated
`POST /v1/members/{did}/personhood/assert` (re-mints VMC with
`personhood: true`), and revoked via `DELETE` (re-mints with
`false`). The policy re-evaluates on every renewal (§6.3 step 3) —
losing personhood is not gated on operator action.

Policy input contract: `data.input = { applicant_did, vp_claims }`.
Communities extend via `data.*` namespaces they populate themselves.

## 7. Policy engine

### 7.1 Required policies

| Name | Purpose | Default-ship |
|---|---|---|
| `join` | Decide join requests | Template `policies.open` (accept any signed VP) |
| `removal` | Decide admin-initiated removals | Any admin may remove any non-admin |
| `personhood` | Decide personhood assertion | **Deny-all stub** |
| `registry` | Trust-registry publish + departure disposition | Publish on join; default disposition `Tombstone` |
| `directory` | Member-directory visibility | Members see DID + role only |
| `role_definitions` | Map roles to permissions (incl. Custom) | The matrix in §5.3 for standard roles only |
| `cross_community_roles` | Honour external VEC role grants | **Deny-all** |
| `cross_community_relationships` | Store external VRCs | **Deny-all** |
| `relationships` | Store published VRCs | Store if both parties are current members |

### 7.2 Activation

`POST /v1/policies` (admin) uploads + compiles via `regorus` — 400
with compilation errors on failure. `POST /v1/policies/{id}/activate`
atomically swaps the active policy for its purpose; in-flight
requests against the old policy complete; new requests use the new.
`POST /v1/policies/{id}/test` evaluates without activating. No
file-watching, no auto-reload.

### 7.3 Input contracts

| Policy | `input` shape |
|---|---|
| `join` | `{ applicant_did, vp_claims, action: "join", now }` |
| `removal` | `{ actor_did, target_did, target_role, reason, action: "remove", now }` |
| `personhood` | `{ applicant_did, vp_claims }` |
| `registry` | `{ member, action, requested_disposition? }` |
| `directory` | `{ viewer_did, viewer_role, target_member, fields_requested }` |
| `role_definitions` | `{ role, action, resource? }` |
| `cross_community_roles` | `{ foreign_vec, target_role, vtc_state }` |
| `cross_community_relationships` | `{ vrc, viewer_member, vtc_state }` |
| `relationships` | `{ vrc, issuer_member, subject_member }` |

## 8. Trust-registry integration

### 8.1 Startup

VTC publishes its issuer profile via `affinidi-trust-registry-rs` on
boot. Idempotent. Publish failures are non-fatal but raise a state
flag in `GET /v1/community/profile` (`registry_status:
"degraded" | "active"`) and in `/v1/health/diagnostics`. Operators
see the lag without having to grep telemetry.

**PII boundary.** Only `member_did`, `status`, `active_from`,
`active_to`, and `record_id` are written to the registry. The VTC
refuses to publish `extensions`, emails, names, or any other
community-defined fields.

### 8.2 Departure dispositions

| Disposition | Record state | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| **Purge** | Record deleted | Right-to-be-forgotten; private communities |
| **Tombstone** | `status: Departed`, no date range | "Was a member, no longer" — minimal disclosure |
| **Historical** | `status: Departed`, dates populated | Audit / retroactive verification |

Decision flow: `registry.rego` sets the envelope
(`publish_on_join`, `departure_options`, `default_departure`,
`min_disposition` floor). Member preference clamps within the
envelope. A member-initiated `Purge` **always overrides
`min_disposition`** (RTBF). Logged as
`RegistryRecordPolicyOverride { reason: "rtbf" }` with HMAC-hashed
identifier (§11.1).

**Timing-correlation mitigation.** RTBF-triggered registry mutations
are coalesced into a daily batch (configurable;
`registry.rtbf_batch_window_hours`, default 24) so that record
disappearance cannot be timed-aligned with a specific override
event. Status-list bit flips remain immediate locally.

### 8.3 Reconciliation (`MembershipSyncer`)

Tokio task subscribed to `MemberAdded`, `MemberRemoved`,
`RoleChanged`. Enqueues `SyncJob`s into a `sync_queue` keyspace;
retries with exponential backoff. Boot-time replay.

**Visible failure.** Persistent sync failure (default ≥ 1 hour
behind, configurable) surfaces in:
- `GET /v1/community/profile` (`registry_status`)
- `GET /v1/health/diagnostics`
- Admin UX status pings

For `Purge` jobs that fail to sync, the warning is escalated — a
locally-deleted member still recognised externally is the silent
privacy regression the disposition is meant to prevent.

### 8.4 Cross-community recognition

`cross_community_roles.rego` decides whether a foreign VEC's role
claim maps to a local ACL role. Default deny-all.

**Session-mint hardening.**

- The foreign VEC must pass StatusList revocation check at
  session-mint time (the issuer's status list URL is resolved live).
- The foreign issuer must be present in the trust-registry's
  recognition graph at the time of mint.
- The minted session's TTL is clamped to the shortest of: the JWT
  audience default, the foreign VEC's `validUntil`, the foreign
  VMC's `validUntil`.
- Recognition is **not cached**; every session mint re-runs the
  full policy + StatusList + trust-registry check. A peer community
  removed from the registry mid-session does not retain access on
  refresh.

## 9. Wire protocols

### 9.1 Common conventions

- **URL versioning.** All REST under `/v1/`. Adding `/v2/` is the
  explicit mechanism for breaking changes.
- **Idempotency keys.** Every mutating endpoint accepts
  `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>`. Cache key is `(session_id, idempotency_key)` —
  **not** global. Idempotent retries from a different principal
  receive their own response, not the cached one. Cache TTL: 24 h
  for non-destructive operations; **destructive operations
  (`DELETE`, removal, revocation) cache for 60 s only**, and re-validate
  target state before returning a cached response. Same key + different
  body → 422 `IdempotencyKeyConflict`.
- **Cursor pagination.** All list endpoints accept
  `?cursor=&limit=` (limit 1..200). Response includes `next_cursor`
  (nullable) and optional `total_estimate`.

### 9.2 Routing modes

Each surface (API, admin UX, website) mounts on a path prefix, a
Host header, or both. Default is **path-prefix on a single host** —
works on day one without DNS configuration.

```toml
# Default (path mode)
[routing.api]       mount = "/v1"
[routing.admin_ui]  mount = "/admin"
[routing.website]   mount = "/"            # catch-all, lowest priority
```

Route priority (highest first): `/health`, `/v1/*`,
`/v1/website/*` (management API), `/admin/*`, `/*` (public site).

**Subdomain mode**: per-surface `host` set; tower middleware routes
by `Host`. Hosts not matching any surface return 404. Subdomain mode
implies the operator handles per-surface TLS certs and DNS.

**Multi-process daemons are not in MVP.** fjall is not multi-process-safe.
Operators who need isolation strip surfaces at compile time via cargo
features and put a reverse proxy / CDN in front.

### 9.3 CORS + cookie scope

`cors.allowed_origins` is a configured allowlist. Wildcards refused.

**Isolation invariant.** When the public website (§12.1) and the
admin UX (§12.2) are served on the same domain, they **must** be on
different cookie scopes. Path-mode default achieves this by setting
the admin session cookie with `Path=/admin; SameSite=Strict;
Secure; HttpOnly`; the public website's origin gains no
implicit access to admin session cookies.

Admin UX in `embedded` mode: same-origin or near-origin; no CORS
allowance for the admin UX itself.
Admin UX in `external` mode: install flow writes the external origin
into `cors.allowed_origins`.

The public website's origin is **not** auto-allowed for admin
endpoints. The public site can POST to `/v1/join-requests`
(unauthenticated) without preflight via simple-request semantics.

**CSRF on admin mutating endpoints.** Every admin endpoint requires
either `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` or a CSRF double-submit cookie.
Both checks are belt-and-braces: form-encoded POSTs from public-site
JavaScript can't forge admin actions.

### 9.4 Trust Tasks

Every wire op binds to a versioned Trust Task identified by URL on
[trusttasks.org](https://trusttasks.org):

```
https://trusttasks.org/{org}/{domain}/{path}/{major}.{minor}
```

For this workspace: `org = openvtc`, `domain = vtc`. Example:
`https://trusttasks.org/openvtc/vtc/join/request/submit/1.0`.

**REST binding.** Every request carries a `Trust-Task` header. The
header is **exact-matched** against the handler's registered task
URL at route attach time — not by prefix, not by major-version
family. Mismatch → 415 `TrustTaskMismatch`; missing → 400
`TrustTaskMissing`. **Exception**: `/health` is exempt to keep
monitoring trivial; this is the only exempt endpoint and is
documented.

**DIDComm binding.** The DIDComm message `type` field **is** the
Trust Task URL. No shorthand; no parallel registry.

**Spec format.** Two artefacts under `trust-tasks/{path}/{major}.{minor}/`:

- `spec.md` — narrative with frontmatter (id, title, status,
  authors, inputs/outputs, trust assumptions, related).
- `schema.json` — JSON Schema for input/output.

Plus `trust-tasks/index.json` manifest. trusttasks.org publishes
from this manifest via CI on merge to main.

**Status lifecycle.** Draft → Reviewing → Published → Deprecated.
Draft entries are wire-referenceable. Published entries have frozen
schemas; further changes require a major bump.

**MVP gate (soft).** Every operation that ships in MVP must have a
Trust Task with a stable ID and at least a Draft `spec.md` before
its endpoint ships. Published status is the target for v1.0 of the
VTC, not the MVP gate. Published requires `schema.json` complete +
at least one conformance test + no breaking changes since first
Draft.

Source-of-truth location, full ~50-entry catalog, governance, and
the workspace's `vti-trust-tasks` integration crate live in the
sibling document `trust-tasks-spec.md` — they are too long for the
core MVP spec.

```

### 9.6 DIDComm surface

Every REST mutating op has a DIDComm twin under the Trust Task URL.
The DIDComm `type` field is the Trust Task URL directly — no
shorthand. Notable absences:

- Install + passkey registration: REST-only (§4.3).
- `/health` + diagnostics: REST-only.
- Website management: REST-only.

**Per-DID rate limit.** DIDComm strips IP, so unauthenticated rate
limiting on `community/1.0/join-request` uses a per-sender-DID
leaky bucket (`didcomm.join_rate.bucket_capacity` and `refill_per_min`)
in the DIDComm handler, executed *before* policy evaluation. Other
DIDComm routes inherit the same per-DID limit, configurable per
Trust Task ID.

### 9.7 Auth + sessions

- Challenge-response with JWT audience `"VTC"` — cross-audience
  tokens rejected.
- Sessions issued from REST (Bearer) or DIDComm (authcrypt sender).
- **Step-up reauth** required for: passkey enrolment / revocation,
  admin promotion, emergency operations. Implemented as a fresh
  WebAuthn user-verification ceremony embedded in the request.
- Cross-community sessions (§8.4): TTL clamped to inputs, recognition
  re-evaluated on every refresh.

## 10. Member lifecycle

### 10.1 Join

```
applicant → POST /v1/join-requests (or DIDComm twin)
  { applicant_did, vp, registry_consent?, extensions? }

VTC:
  1. Verify VP signature → VerifiedJoinRequest (typestate)
  2. Run join.rego with input.vp_claims
  3. allow:
     a. Allocate status-list index (random; flipped slots excluded)
     b. Mint VMC + role VEC via the VTC's local signer (§3-A; in-process)
     c. Write ACL + Member, enqueue registry.rego decision
     d. Sealed-transfer credentials to applicant_did
     e. Audit: JoinRequestApproved + MemberAdded
  4. deny:
     a. Persist JoinRequest as Rejected with decision rationale
     b. DIDComm reject (where reachable)
     c. Audit: JoinRequestRejected
```

### 10.2 Removal

**No-last-admin invariant.** Self-removal by the sole remaining
admin is refused with 409 `LastAdminProtected`. Admin must demote
or promote a successor first. Same check applies to admin removal
of another admin — refused if the result would be zero admins.

Self-removal (`DELETE /v1/members/me`):

```
{ disposition: Purge | Tombstone | Historical | PolicyDefault }
```

Atomic local: delete ACL, anonymise Member record, flip status-list
bit (immediate), emit `MemberRemoved`. Registry sync enqueued.

Admin removal (`DELETE /v1/members/{did}`): admin role plus
`removal.rego` policy gate. Otherwise same effects.

### 10.3 Renewal

See §6.3. Unconditional on ACL membership.

### 10.4 Role change

`PATCH /v1/members/{did}` accepts role changes **except** to
`Admin`. Admin promotion is a separate endpoint:

```
POST /v1/members/{did}/promote-to-admin
```

requiring:

- caller role = `Admin`
- step-up WebAuthn UV ceremony in the same request (§9.7)
- audit event `AdminPromoted` (its own variant, not a generic
  `RoleChanged`) — distinct event type for SIEM filtering

ACL update + new VEC issuance + sealed transfer + DIDComm
notification mirror non-admin role change.

### 10.5 DID rotation

| Member DID method | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **did:webvh** | Native: VTC resolves new DID, walks `did.jsonl` history, verifies prior-key signature. No additional credential. |
| **did:key** | Co-signed rotation attestation. |

**did:key rotation contract.**

- VTC issues a single-use `rotation_id` via
  `POST /v1/members/me/rotate/challenge` (auth: old DID's current session).
  Server-issued, bound to old DID, 10-minute TTL.
- Rotation payload `{ old_did, new_did, vtc_did, rotation_id, expires_at }`
  is **domain-tag-prefixed** with the literal `vtc-did-rotation/v1\0`
  before signing (mirrors `vta-sealed-transfer/v1` doctrine). Domain
  separation prevents cross-protocol signature reuse.
- Payload signed by **both** old and new keys.
- `POST /v1/members/me/rotate` authenticates via the *new* DID's
  session; VTC verifies both signatures, the rotation_id is consumed,
  ACL updated atomically.
- **All sessions, refresh tokens, idempotency-cached responses, and
  in-flight DIDComm threads keyed on the old DID are revoked in the
  same transaction.**
- Status-list index reused (member identity continuous), VMC + role
  VEC re-issued to new DID.

Members must use `did:key` or `did:webvh` (workspace doctrine).

### 10.6 Personhood

See §6.4.

## 11. Audit log

### 11.1 Envelope + identifier hashing

```
struct AuditEnvelope {
    event_id: Uuid,
    event_version: u32,        // bumped on breaking shape change
    schema_version: u32,
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    actor_did_hash:  [u8; 32], // HMAC-SHA256(audit_key, did_bytes)
    actor_did_plain: Option<String>,
    target_did_hash:  Option<[u8; 32]>,
    target_did_plain: Option<String>,
    event: AuditEvent,         // tagged enum, see §11.4
}
```

**HMAC, not plain hash.** The audit secret `audit_key` is stored
separately from the audit log (own keyspace, encrypted under the
VTC seed), per-community. Plain SHA-256 over a DID is reversible by
enumeration (DIDs are a small public space).

**RTBF.** Right-to-be-forgotten requests null the `*_plain` fields
and **rotate the `audit_key`**. Pre-rotation hashes become opaque to
anyone without the prior key; post-rotation events use the new key.
Audit chain integrity preserved via the per-envelope `event_id`.

### 11.2 Query

`GET /v1/audit?since=&until=&type=&actor_did=&target_did=&cursor=&limit=`.
Indices on `timestamp`, `type`, `actor_did_hash`, `target_did_hash`
maintained on write.

### 11.3 Retention

Default: retain forever. Per-event-type max retention configurable
via `audit.retention.<event_type>`. **Pruner concurrency**: pruner
reads a snapshot cutoff timestamp; writes are append-only above the
cutoff. Pruner never deletes events younger than
`cutoff + audit.pruner_safety_margin` (default 1 h) — protects
against in-flight events being dropped.

### 11.4 Event vocabulary

Tagged enum (`#[serde(tag = "type", content = "data")]`). Variants
emitted from each lifecycle section (§4, §10, §6, §8, §14.6).
`AdminPromoted` is its own variant (§10.4). `ConfigChanged` carries
per-key sensitivity: keys flagged `sensitive: true` redact
`old_value` + `new_value` in the audit record (e.g., TLS paths;
future webhook URLs with tokens). Complete catalog lives alongside
the source in `vti-common::audit::events`.

## 12. Optional surfaces

### 12.1 Public community website (`website` feature)

Filesystem-backed static hosting. Files live at
`website.root_dir`; can be edited directly (`scp`, `rsync`, `git`)
or via the REST API. No template engine, no opinions about site
structure.

**Deploy modes** (config `website.deploy_mode`):

- **`"live"`** (default): files served as-is from `root_dir`; bundle
  deploys extract via a *staging directory + atomic rename*, never
  in place (avoids partial reads under concurrent serving).
- **`"managed"`**: `root_dir/gen-N/` directories + `current → gen-N`
  symlink. Bundle deploys extract to a fresh generation; symlink
  swapped atomically. Last 5 generations retained.

**Path safety.**

- All paths canonicalised to `root_dir` real path; any resolution
  that escapes `root_dir` is rejected (400).
- Symlinks within `root_dir` are not followed.
- Unicode-normalised to NFC; non-NFC paths rejected.
- Null bytes, control characters in paths rejected.
- Hidden files (leading `.`) not served.

**Content security.**

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on every response.
- Default CSP disables inline JavaScript on the public site:
  `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'`.
  Configurable per-site for SPA needs.
- MIME types from extension (`mime_guess`), no sniffing.
- Forbid serving files with executable bits or with extensions in
  the configured `website.executable_blocklist` (default: `.cgi`,
  `.php`, `.exe`).

**Cookie isolation.** See §9.3. The website's origin must not share
cookie scope with the admin UX.

**Form submission.** The static site POSTs directly to
`/v1/join-requests`. No proxy endpoint.

`ETag` (SHA-256 of content) + `Cache-Control` so a CDN can sit in
front. Live-mode file-descriptor cache TTL configurable
(`website.live_cache_ttl_seconds`, default 5).

### 12.2 Admin UX (`admin-ui` feature)

The admin UX is a static SPA built and released from
[OpenVTC/vtc-admin-ui](https://github.com/OpenVTC/vtc-admin-ui).
`vtc-service`'s `build.rs` fetches a SHA-256-pinned release tarball
and bakes it via `include_dir!`. Tarball must be **signed by the
OpenVTC release key**; `build.rs` verifies the signature *and* the
digest before extracting. Offline builds use a vendored fallback
under `VTC_OFFLINE_BUILD=1`.

`admin_ui.mode = "embedded"` (default) serves the baked SPA at the
configured mount. `mode = "external"` skips embedding; the operator
hosts the UX elsewhere and the VTC just allows the origin in CORS.

**WebAuthn `RP ID`.** With path-mode routing the `RP ID` is the base
host. With subdomain routing, set `RP ID` to the *base domain* so
credentials remain valid across subdomains. Migrating the admin UX
to a different base domain re-registers all passkeys; documented in
the operator runbook.

### 12.3 VRC graph

Self-issued only in MVP. Members mint VRCs in their wallet/PNM, then:

`POST /v1/relationships` — caller submits a VRC they signed. VTC
verifies signature against the issuer's known DID, runs
`relationships.rego` (default: store if both parties are current
members). Stored in the `relationships` keyspace.

`GET /v1/members/{did}/relationships` returns published VRCs where
the DID is issuer or subject (paginated).

**Departure handling.** When a member is removed:
- VRCs they *issued* are handled per their departure disposition
  (purged on `Purge`).
- VRCs naming them as *subject* — issued by remaining members — are
  also redacted from list endpoints when the departed member chose
  `Purge`. The VRC record itself remains in storage referenced by
  issuer; the public listing strips it.

Bilateral counter-signing is v2.

## 13. Storage

| Keyspace | Existing | Schema |
|---|---|---|
| `sessions` | ✓ | unchanged |
| `acl` | ✓ | extended: `VtcRole` enum + `extensions` |
| `community` | new | singleton key `profile` |
| `policies` | new | active + archived |
| `members` | new | `did → Member` |
| `join_requests` | new | with retention sweeper |
| `invitations` | new | |
| `relationships` | new | |
| `status_lists` | new | per-purpose state + reserved index set |
| `registry_records` | new | |
| `sync_queue` | new | `MembershipSyncer` jobs |
| `audit` | new | `AuditEnvelope` + secondary indices |
| `audit_key` | new | per-community HMAC key + rotation history |
| `idempotency` | new | `(session_id, key) → (request_hash, response, expires_at)` |
| `config` | new | DB-layer overrides |

Public website lives on filesystem at `website.root_dir`, not in
fjall (§3-K).

## 14. Operational

### 14.1 Backup / restore

`POST /v1/admin/backup/export` returns an encrypted dump (Argon2id +
AES-256-GCM). Password strength enforced via `zxcvbn` (minimum
score 3) — `≥12 chars` alone is too weak.

**Cross-VTC restore protection.** Each backup is wrapped under a key
derived from the VTC's master seed (`HKDF(seed, "vtc-backup-key")`),
not just the public DID. A spoofer who provisions a new VTC with the
same DNS cannot restore a stolen backup — they would need the
original master seed, which is OS-keyring-resident.

A fresh-install VTC accepts any backup once. A configured VTC refuses
backups whose `community_did` doesn't match. Same primitive as VTA's
`check_vta_did_compatibility`.

**Scrub on export.** `sessions` and `idempotency` keyspaces are
excluded from backups — they contain ephemeral state and may include
secret-bearing cached responses.

### 14.2 Runtime configuration

Three-layer overlay:
`env_vars > db_overrides > config.toml > defaults`.

`GET /v1/admin/config` returns the effective config with per-field
`source` annotation and `requires_restart: bool`. `PATCH` writes to
the `config` keyspace. `POST .../reload` re-applies hot-reloadable
settings; `POST .../restart` initiates graceful shutdown.

**Restart-endpoint supervisor handshake.** The restart endpoint
refuses to exit unless a supervisor is detected — either
`VTC_SUPERVISED=1` or the systemd notify socket (`NOTIFY_SOCKET`)
or k8s downward-API marker present. Without a supervisor, restart
would be a one-shot DoS.

**Sensitive-path PATCH guard.** Mutable config keys carry a
sensitivity flag. `server.tls.cert_path`, `server.tls.key_path`,
and `storage.path` are configured to **a directory allowlist**;
PATCH values outside the allowlist are rejected (refusing requests
to point TLS at `/etc/shadow` or to relocate storage transparently).

**Config import audit.** `POST /v1/admin/config/import` runs a
diff-and-confirm flow: the response surfaces every changed field
with a pre-apply preview; a second call with `confirm=true` applies.
Per-field audit events emitted on apply.

Full config taxonomy (which key reloads, which restarts, which is
UX-settable, sensitive-flag) lives in `docs/04-reference/vtc-config.md`,
not in this spec.

**Remote-dependency breakers.** VMC + VEC issuance is in-process
in Phase 2 (§3-A — cached-locally signer), so the per-call
timeout and circuit-breaker configuration apply to **non-VMC
remote dependencies only**: the trust-registry publish path in
Phase 3 (`MembershipSyncer`) and the did:webvh resolver walk in
M2.15.2's rotation slice. The configuration knobs retain their
names (`vta.signing_timeout_seconds`, default 5;
`vta.circuit_breaker_threshold`, default 5 consecutive failures)
for forward compatibility — they are the workspace's canonical
"remote-call discipline" handles. The breaker-open semantics
(join → `Deferred`, renewal → 503,
`/v1/health/diagnostics` surfaces remote health) apply to those
non-VMC paths once they land. Clarified per Phase 2 M2.16.

### 14.3 Telemetry + diagnostics

Reuses `vti_common::telemetry::TelemetrySink`. `/v1/health/diagnostics`
(admin) surfaces:

- Remote-dependency health (trust-registry publish, did:webvh
  resolver) + last-success timestamp
- Status-list occupancy per purpose
- `MembershipSyncer` queue depth + last-success/failure
- Active policy IDs + SHA-256 per purpose
- Trust-registry sync status
- Telemetry ring-buffer snapshot

`/health` (unauthenticated, Trust-Task-exempt §9.4) returns 200 when
the daemon is responsive and storage is reachable.

### 14.4 Runtime guards (workspace doctrine)

Inherited from the workspace's standard guards: tower-governor on
unauth routes (5 rps + 10 burst per IP); 1 MB global body cap;
audience-isolated JWTs; install carve-out is single-use (§4).

**Body-cap exception.** Website upload routes
(`POST /v1/website/deploy`, `PUT /v1/website/files/{path}`) override
the global body cap with per-route caps from
`website.max_bundle_size_mb` (default 50) and `max_file_size_mb`
(default 10). All other routes inherit 1 MB.

## 15. CLI

`cnm-cli` gains `cnm community` subcommands grouped by area
(`setup`, `status`, `profile`, `policies`, `members`, `join`,
`invitations`, `website`, `registry`, `status-lists`, `audit`,
`backup`, `config`, `daemon`).

Commands are thin wrappers over `vta-sdk` REST/DIDComm clients —
workspace doctrine. Detailed verb list lives in
`docs/04-reference/cnm-vtc-cli.md`.

## 16. Phasing

| Phase | Deliverable | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | `vtc-host` template, install wizard, WebAuthn install flow, multi-passkey admin DID, community profile, config plumbing | DID + auth foundation. |
| **1** | Role enum + custom roles, ACL extension, member CRUD with manual approval, self/admin removal (no-last-admin), audit envelope + HMAC, idempotency, `/v1/` versioning, cursor pagination | Members can exist. |
| **2** | `regorus`, policy upload + activate, `join.rego` + `removal.rego`, **in-process VMC + VEC issuance** (cached-locally signer per §3-A), status-list with reserved-index discipline, renewal, DID rotation (`did:key` + `did:webvh`, domain-tagged) | Live policy + credentials. |
| **3** | Trust-registry publish, three departure dispositions, `registry.rego`, `MembershipSyncer` + diagnostic surfacing, RTBF override + batched timing, cross-community recognition (session-mint hardening) | Community on the wider network. |
| **4** | VRC self-issuance + `relationships.rego`, `personhood.rego` (deny-all stub) + assert/revoke + renewal re-eval, custom endorsement issuance (issuer role) | Graph + personhood live. |
| **5** | Public website (filesystem-backed, CSP, path safety), admin UX consumed via `build.rs` (release-key-signed tarball), path-prefix routing default + subdomain support | MVP complete. |

Phase 5 sub-tasks parallelise with phases 3–4. Phases 0–4 strictly
serial. Each phase's PR set includes the Draft Trust Task spec files
alongside the code that implements the operations (§9.4 soft gate).

## 17. Open questions

These have proposed answers in the design history but remain to
validate at implementation:

1. **Personhood policy reference implementation.** Stub ships
   deny-all; the workspace should publish at least one reference
   policy (`docs/04-reference/personhood-templates.md`) once Phase 4
   lands so communities don't reinvent from scratch.
2. **Status-list chaining strategy.** MVP alerts at 75% and refuses
   beyond capacity. Production communities will exceed 131K members
   eventually. Plan: chained-list pointer in the BitstringStatusList
   credential header.
3. **Trust Tasks source-of-truth location.** Currently
   `trust-tasks/` in this workspace. May factor out to a dedicated
   `OpenVTC/trust-tasks` repo when VTA-side tasks appear.
4. **Conformance test pattern for Published Trust Tasks.** Probably
   golden request/response pairs + schema validation. Land with the
   first Published task and standardise.
5. **Audit `audit_key` rotation cadence.** RTBF triggers rotation;
   spec is silent on routine rotation. Default policy TBD —
   probably annual + on every backup-export rekey.
6. **VRC issuance over DIDComm vs REST UX.** Both work; member
   wallets typically prefer DIDComm. No technical fork; UX call.

## 18. Explicitly NOT in MVP

- **TEE / Nitro Enclave deployment of the VTC binary** — permanent
  non-goal (§3-K). Trust anchor for TEE remains the VTA.
- **Multi-tenant** (one binary hosts multiple communities).
- **Multi-process daemons sharing fjall storage.** Operator
  isolation via cargo features + reverse proxy is the MVP path.
- **N-of-M admin approvals.** Retrofit is bounded (insert a
  `proposal` phase before ~8 endpoints).
- **Webhooks / external event subscribers.** Stable audit event
  vocabulary (§11.4) makes this a delivery layer on top.
- **Bulk operations** (mass-invite, mass-remove, mass-export).
- **WASM / plugin extensions.** Communities extend via Rego +
  JSON blobs only.
- **i18n at the resource layer** (translated profile fields, role
  names). Additive migration via `name_translations` field with
  fallback.
- **VPC (Persona credentials)** beyond type-reservation.
- **Bilateral VRC counter-signing.** Self-issued only in MVP.
- **VTC-to-VTC community migration tooling.** Config export +
  backup are the primitives; packaged scripts are a follow-up.
- **Onboarding state machine** for new members. Encode in policy +
  admin UX initially.
- **Filesystem / S3 backends for fjall keyspaces** beyond the
  public website root.
