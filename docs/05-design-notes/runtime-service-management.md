# Spec: Runtime service-endpoint management

Status: **DRAFT — Phase 1 (Specify)**
Owner: Glenn Gore
Last updated: 2026-05-06

## 1. Objective

Allow a super-admin to add, update, or remove service entries on a
**running VTA's DID document** without rebuilding the binary or
re-running setup. Each mutation publishes a new WebVH LogEntry that
re-uses the existing verification methods. The mutation is reachable
from both the VTA local CLI (`vta`) and PNM (`pnm`), over both REST
and DIDComm transports — except where a transport must necessarily be
absent (you cannot enable DIDComm over DIDComm).

This generalizes the DIDComm-specific protocol-management work that
shipped on `sealed-bootstrap` (commits up to 88dab00) into a unified
service-management surface that also handles REST. The DIDComm-only
operator surface (`pnm services enable|disable didcomm`,
`pnm mediator …`) is **retired** and replaced by the new unified shape.

### Why this matters

* Operators today must rebuild and re-deploy a VTA to change its
  published REST URL (e.g., domain migration).
* "DIDComm-only" and "REST-only" deployments are valid topologies but
  the only way to reach them today is editing config files at boot.
* The DIDComm migrate-with-drain machinery is already well-tested;
  exposing it through a generic service-management surface makes the
  REST equivalent (URL update, on/off) a thin extension instead of a
  parallel system.

### Non-goals

* Hot-swapping the Axum listener bind address, port, or TLS cert.
  Those remain process-config and are set at boot. This spec only
  changes what the DID document **advertises**.
* Adding service kinds beyond REST and DIDComm. Operator-defined
  service types are a separate, larger design (extensible kinds need
  schema, validation, telemetry hooks).
* REST drain/replay. REST is request/response; removing a URL from
  the DID document means clients resolve a 410 and retry. There is
  no buffered-message concept on the REST side.
* Multi-service atomic transactions. Each mutation is one LogEntry,
  one transport, one service. See §6.

## 2. Tech Stack & Codebase Context

* Rust workspace, edition 2024, MSRV 1.94.0
* Existing modules to extend (do **not** fork):
  * `vta-service/src/operations/protocol/` — operation handlers
  * `vta-service/src/messaging/{registry,drain_store,drain_sweeper,handshake,live_prover,transient_handshake}.rs` — DIDComm mediator state machinery
  * `vta-service/src/operations/did_webvh/mod.rs` — LogEntry publication
  * `vta-service/src/routes/protocol.rs` — REST handlers
  * `vta-service/src/messaging/handlers_protocol.rs` — DIDComm handlers
  * `vta-sdk/src/protocol/` — wire types (`vta_sdk::protocol::*`)
  * `vta-cli-common/src/commands/{services,mediator}.rs` — CLI commands
  * `vti-common/src/telemetry/` — pluggable telemetry sink
* Existing invariants that must continue to hold:
  * `verificationMethod` is byte-identical across LogEntries
  * Each service mutation publishes exactly one LogEntry
  * Drain set is fjall-persisted, restart-resilient, capped at
    30 days (`MAX_DRAIN_TTL`)
  * `MIN_DRAIN_TTL_OVER_DIDCOMM = 3600s` floor when the disable
    command is *itself* delivered over DIDComm (so the operator
    isn't cut off mid-command)

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Service kinds and operations

Two transport kinds are managed: `rest` and `didcomm`.

| Kind | enable | update | disable | rollback | drain |
|------|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-----:|
| rest | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| didcomm | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

REST mutations are immediate (publication-only; no in-flight state).
DIDComm mutations route through the existing handshake / drain /
sweeper machinery unchanged.

**Rollback is fail-forward** for both kinds — see §3.5a.

### 3.2 Brick-prevention invariant

**At least one service kind must be enabled at all times.**

The operation layer rejects any mutation that would leave the DID
document with zero advertised services. Specifically:

* `services rest disable` is rejected with `409 LastServiceRefused`
  if DIDComm is currently disabled.
* `services didcomm disable` is rejected with `409 LastServiceRefused`
  if REST is currently disabled.

There is **no `--force` escape hatch.** If an operator genuinely
wants a totally-unreachable VTA they can rotate it out and replace
it via setup; the CLI will not provide a foot-gun.

### 3.3 DIDComm-preferred ordering

When both services are advertised, the DID document MUST signal
DIDComm as the preferred transport for clients that support it.
Encoding mechanism is finalized in Phase 2 (Plan); candidates:

* DIDComm v2 `priority` key on the DIDComm service entry
  (lower number = higher priority)
* Array ordering convention (DIDComm before REST)

Whichever is chosen, the rendering is centralized in the WebVH
operation layer so REST clients see consistent ordering.

### 3.4 REST-specific behavior

* `services rest enable --url <url>` adds a service entry of
  type `LinkedDomains` (or our REST-specific type — to be confirmed
  in Plan against the existing DID template's REST shape) with
  the supplied URL.
* `services rest update --url <url>` replaces the URL on the
  existing REST service entry. Errors with `409 ServiceNotPresent`
  if REST isn't currently advertised.
* `services rest disable` removes the REST service entry.

The Axum listener itself is **not** torn down — it stays running so
local CLI traffic and management endpoints remain reachable. Only
the *advertisement* changes.

URL validation: must be `https://` (TLS-only), parsable by `url::Url`,
no fragment, no userinfo. Enforced in `vta-sdk` so both transports
share the rule.

### 3.5 DIDComm-specific behavior

`services didcomm enable --mediator <did>` is REST-only by nature
(can't bootstrap DIDComm over DIDComm). Internally identical to
today's `enable_didcomm` operation:

1. Transient `DIDCommService` spun up
2. Handshake against the candidate mediator
3. On success, mediator pinned, transient teardown
4. LogEntry published with DIDComm service entry

`services didcomm update --mediator <new-did> [--drain-ttl <dur>]`
replaces today's `pnm mediator migrate`:

1. Live `DIDCommServiceProver` handshake against new mediator
2. New mediator becomes primary; old mediator moved to drain set
3. Drain TTL = `--drain-ttl` arg, else **24h default** (new — see §3.6)
4. LogEntry published with updated DIDComm service entry

`services didcomm disable [--drain-ttl <dur>]` replaces today's
`disable_didcomm`. Removes DIDComm service entry; pins drain TTL on
the previously-active mediator. Refused if REST is also disabled
(see §3.2).

`services didcomm rollback` is described in §3.5a (transport-agnostic
fail-forward semantic).

`services didcomm drain list` shows current drain set.
`services didcomm drain cancel <mediator-did>` removes a mediator
from the drain set immediately. Both already exist; only renamed.

### 3.5a Rollback semantic — fail-forward

WebVH is an append-only ledger. We never rewind the chain; we never
mark an entry "reverted." `rollback` is operator-friendly
terminology for **"publish a new LogEntry that re-applies the
previous service configuration for this kind."**

Mechanics:

1. The operation layer looks up the kind's *prior* config — the
   service-entry shape that was in effect immediately before the
   most recent mutation of that kind.
2. It runs the equivalent forward operation:
   * Most recent mutation was `update X→Y` → rollback runs an
     `update Y→X`.
   * Most recent mutation was `disable` (from config X) → rollback
     runs an `enable X`.
   * Most recent mutation was `enable X` → rollback runs `disable`
     (subject to §3.2 brick-prevention).
3. A new LogEntry is published with the resulting service[].
4. For DIDComm, the drain set is updated by the same path the
   forward operation would use — e.g., rolling back an `update
   A→B` puts mediator B into the drain set with the supplied
   `--drain-ttl` (default 24h).

Properties:

* **Single-step only.** Rollback reverts exactly one prior
  mutation per kind. Rolling back twice in a row first undoes the
  most recent mutation, then would undo the *next* most recent
  mutation — which is two distinct user actions, not one.
* **Independent per kind.** REST rollback ignores DIDComm history
  and vice versa. Each kind tracks its own "previous-config"
  pointer.
* **Subject to §3.2.** A rollback that would leave zero advertised
  services is rejected with `LastServiceRefused`, identical to a
  direct `disable`.
* **Subject to TTL bounds.** A DIDComm rollback that would put a
  mediator into the drain set obeys the same `MIN_DRAIN_TTL_OVER_
  DIDCOMM` / `MAX_DRAIN_TTL` bounds as a direct `update`.
* **No special "reverted" telemetry.** The emitted event is the
  forward operation's event (`service.didcomm.updated`,
  `service.rest.enabled`, etc.) with a `triggered_by: "rollback"`
  field, so operators see in telemetry what actually changed.

Implementation note: each successful mutation persists its
"previous-config" snapshot in fjall, replacing the one from before.
Rollback consumes the snapshot. After rollback, the snapshot
reflects the state from *before* the rollback (so a second
consecutive rollback would revert the rollback — a no-op cycle the
operator can avoid by checking `services list` first).

### 3.6 Default drain TTL

* New default: **24 hours** when the operator omits `--drain-ttl`
  on `update` or `disable`.
* Floor: existing `MIN_DRAIN_TTL_OVER_DIDCOMM = 3600s` retained
  (only when the command is delivered over DIDComm).
* Cap: existing `MAX_DRAIN_TTL = 30 days` retained.
* Per the user's input, this default is applied retroactively — no
  feature flag or migration period (no production users yet).

### 3.7 Audit & telemetry

Each successful mutation emits a telemetry event via the existing
`vti_common::telemetry::TelemetrySink`. Event names:

* `service.rest.enabled` / `service.rest.updated` / `service.rest.disabled`
* `service.didcomm.enabled` / `service.didcomm.updated` /
  `service.didcomm.disabled` / `service.didcomm.rolled_back`
* Existing drain events (`drain.started`, `drain.expired`,
  `drain.cancelled`) keep their current names

Each event carries the new LogEntry version-id so an external
verifier can join telemetry to WebVH history.

### 3.8 Authorization

Super-admin only on every operation. No context-admin path.
Implementation reuses the existing JWT role check from
`routes/protocol.rs`; no new claim shapes.

## 4. Wire Types (additions to vta-sdk)

New module: `vta_sdk::protocol::services` (existing
`vta_sdk::protocol` houses DIDComm-specific types; we extend it).

```rust
// Request shapes — exact field names finalized in Plan
pub struct EnableRestRequest { pub url: Url }
pub struct UpdateRestRequest { pub url: Url }
pub struct DisableRestRequest;

pub struct EnableDidcommRequest {
    pub mediator_did: String,
    pub routing_keys: Option<Vec<String>>,
}
pub struct UpdateDidcommRequest {
    pub mediator_did: String,
    pub routing_keys: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub drain_ttl: Option<Duration>,
}
pub struct DisableDidcommRequest {
    pub drain_ttl: Option<Duration>,
}

// Rollback (per §3.5a, fail-forward — the new LogEntry is just a
// re-application of the prior config, no special chain marker).
pub struct RollbackRestRequest;
pub struct RollbackDidcommRequest {
    // Used only when the rollback target is the previous mediator
    // and that target had a drain TTL set; lets the operator
    // override the 24h default.
    pub drain_ttl: Option<Duration>,
}

// Response (unified)
pub struct ServiceMutationResponse {
    pub log_entry_version_id: String,
    pub effective_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub drain_until: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,  // didcomm only
}
```

`VtaError` gains typed variants so the CLI can emit guidance
(per CLAUDE.md "Operator errors should suggest the fix"):

* `LastServiceRefused` — would leave the VTA unreachable
* `ServiceNotPresent` — `update`/`disable` on a kind that's already off
* `ServiceAlreadyEnabled` — `enable` on a kind that's already on
* `MediatorHandshakeFailed { reason }` — DIDComm handshake refused
* `DrainTtlOutOfBounds { min, max, requested }`
* `NoPriorMutation` — `rollback` with no eligible prior mutation
* `UnsupportedTransport` — command delivered over a transport that
  cannot serve it (e.g., `services didcomm enable` over DIDComm)

## 5. CLI Surface

### 5.1 Final shape

```
pnm services list
pnm services rest enable      --url <url>
pnm services rest update      --url <url>
pnm services rest disable
pnm services rest rollback
pnm services didcomm enable   --mediator <did> [--routing-keys <k1,k2>]
pnm services didcomm update   --mediator <did> [--routing-keys ...] [--drain-ttl 24h]
pnm services didcomm disable  [--drain-ttl 24h]
pnm services didcomm rollback [--drain-ttl 24h]
pnm services didcomm drain list
pnm services didcomm drain cancel <mediator-did>
pnm services report
```

The `vta` local CLI mirrors the same shape (`vta services …`).

### 5.2 Removed commands

These are **deleted** (breaking change per user direction):

* `pnm services enable didcomm`
* `pnm services disable didcomm`
* `pnm mediator migrate`
* `pnm mediator rollback`
* `pnm mediator drain cancel`
* `pnm mediator report`

The `mediator` subcommand namespace is removed entirely from `pnm`
and `cnm`. `vta-cli-common/src/commands/mediator.rs` is deleted;
`services.rs` is rewritten.

### 5.3 CLI surface — design rationale

I considered four shapes and picked Option B. Recording the rejected
alternatives so future contributors know why we didn't go that way:

* **Option A — keep separate.** `pnm services enable|disable rest`
  alongside `pnm mediator migrate`. Asymmetric: DIDComm gets a
  privileged top-level namespace, REST doesn't. Rejected.
* **Option B — unify under `pnm services`. ✓ chosen.** One namespace;
  `<kind>` is the dispatch axis. Verbs like `update`, `rollback`,
  `drain` slot under the kind they apply to. Adding a future
  protocol kind is purely additive.
* **Option C — move under `pnm setup`.** `pnm setup services rest …`.
  Rejected: `setup` today is a *cold-start* lifecycle (mints initial
  DID, establishes operator-VTA relationship). Service mutation is
  steady-state. Conflating one-shot bootstrap with everyday
  reconfiguration in muscle memory invites mistakes — operators run
  setup once but may run service mutations many times.
* **Option D — flat verbs with `--kind` flag.** `pnm services add
  --kind rest --url …`. Shallow tree but every command needs the
  flag, and DIDComm-only verbs (`drain`, `rollback`) read awkwardly.
  Rejected.

## 6. Atomicity Model

* **One LogEntry per mutation. One mutation per command.**
* No multi-service atomic ops. Per user direction in clarifying Q6,
  the CLI deliberately does not offer "change REST and DIDComm at
  the same time" — that's how operators brick themselves.
* Sequence: validate → mutate runtime state (e.g., mediator pin,
  drain set) → publish LogEntry → emit telemetry. If LogEntry
  publication fails, runtime state must roll back. Tested in
  `migrate_mediator.rs` today; reuse that pattern for REST.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

A criterion is met when there's a passing test (unit, integration,
or e2e against the test mediator) demonstrating it. Manual checks
are not sufficient.

### Functional
- [ ] `pnm services list` returns current services with their config
      (URL for REST; mediator DID + drain set for DIDComm).
- [ ] `pnm services rest enable --url https://x.example` adds a REST
      service entry and publishes one LogEntry; `verificationMethod`
      unchanged.
- [ ] `pnm services rest update --url …` replaces the URL on the
      existing entry; one new LogEntry.
- [ ] `pnm services rest disable` removes the REST entry; one new
      LogEntry; rejected with `LastServiceRefused` if DIDComm is off.
- [ ] `pnm services didcomm enable --mediator did:…` mints DIDComm
      service entry via existing `enable_didcomm` flow; one LogEntry.
- [ ] `pnm services didcomm update --mediator did:new` migrates;
      old mediator joins drain set with default 24h TTL.
- [ ] `pnm services didcomm disable` removes DIDComm entry; previous
      mediator drains for 24h by default; rejected with
      `LastServiceRefused` if REST is off.
- [ ] `pnm services didcomm rollback` fail-forwards the most
      recent DIDComm mutation (update, disable, *or* enable),
      publishing a new LogEntry that re-applies the prior config.
- [ ] `pnm services rest rollback` fail-forwards the most recent
      REST mutation symmetrically (update, disable, *or* enable),
      publishing a new LogEntry.
- [ ] `pnm services didcomm drain list` shows currently-draining
      mediators with TTL countdown.
- [ ] `pnm services didcomm drain cancel <did>` removes mediator
      from drain set.

### Invariant
- [ ] No mutation produces a DID document with zero advertised
      services. Verified by property test over all command sequences.
- [ ] Every mutation publishes exactly one new WebVH LogEntry whose
      `verificationMethod` is byte-identical to the prior entry's.
- [ ] Drain TTL clamped to `[3600s over DIDComm | 0 over REST,
      30 days]`; out-of-range requests return
      `DrainTtlOutOfBounds`.
- [ ] DIDComm service entry, when present alongside REST, is
      ordered/priorityed such that a v2-aware client picks DIDComm.

### Transport coverage
- [ ] Every command (except `services didcomm enable`) is reachable
      over both REST and DIDComm. `services didcomm enable` is
      REST-only and rejects DIDComm delivery.
- [ ] REST and DIDComm handlers share the same operation layer —
      no duplicated business logic.

### CLI surface
- [ ] `pnm` and `vta` expose the §5.1 surface; `pnm mediator` and
      `pnm services {enable,disable} didcomm` are gone (no
      deprecation alias).
- [ ] Operator errors print suggested commands per CLAUDE.md
      ("operator errors should suggest the fix").

### Telemetry
- [ ] Each mutation emits a `service.<kind>.<verb>` event carrying
      the new LogEntry version-id.
- [ ] Existing `RingBufferTelemetry` swappability test still passes
      with the new event types.

### Tests
- [ ] Unit tests in each `operations/protocol/*` file cover happy
      path + each rejection variant.
- [ ] Integration tests in `tests/e2e` cover the full coverage
      matrix in §7a against the test mediator.
- [ ] Restart-resilience: drain set survives a process restart
      (existing test extended for the new defaults).

## 7a. End-to-End Coverage Matrix

This section is **part of the acceptance criteria**, not an
appendix. The implementation is not done until every cell below has
a passing test in `tests/e2e`.

### 7a.1 State model

The VTA's published service surface has exactly three valid states
under the §3.2 invariant:

| State | REST | DIDComm |
|:-----:|:----:|:-------:|
| **S1** | on   | off     |
| **S2** | off  | on      |
| **S3** | on   | on      |

`(off, off)` is invariant-violating and is itself a test target —
every command that *would* produce it must be rejected.

### 7a.2 State × Operation matrix

Every cell is a separate e2e test. "✓ → Sn" means accepted and the
state transitions to Sn (or stays). Error cells assert the typed
`VtaError` variant fires; no implementation may collapse them to a
generic string.

| From | rest enable | rest update | rest disable | rest rollback | didcomm enable | didcomm update | didcomm disable | didcomm rollback |
|:----:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|
| **S1** | `ServiceAlreadyEnabled` | ✓ → S1 | `LastServiceRefused` | history-dependent (§7a.5) | ✓ → S3 | `ServiceNotPresent` | `ServiceNotPresent` | `NoPriorMutation` |
| **S2** | ✓ → S3 | `ServiceNotPresent` | `ServiceNotPresent` | history-dependent (§7a.5) | `ServiceAlreadyEnabled` | ✓ → S2 | `LastServiceRefused` | history-dependent (§7a.5) |
| **S3** | `ServiceAlreadyEnabled` | ✓ → S3 | ✓ → S2 | history-dependent (§7a.5) | `ServiceAlreadyEnabled` | ✓ → S3 | ✓ → S1 | history-dependent (§7a.5) |

`NoPriorMutation` is a new typed error variant — added to the §4
list. It fires when `rollback` is called on a service kind that has
no recorded prior mutation to fail-forward from.

Rollback cells say "history-dependent" because, per §3.5a, the
result depends on what the most recent mutation of that kind *was*
— the cell can resolve to any other ✓ outcome or to
`NoPriorMutation` / `LastServiceRefused`.

Total: **24 cells.** All must have an e2e test.

### 7a.3 Transport coverage

Each accepted (✓) cell above is run **twice**: once delivered over
REST, once over DIDComm. Exception: `services didcomm enable` is
REST-only by nature and the DIDComm-transport variant is replaced
by an `UnsupportedTransport` rejection test.

For S2 (REST off), REST-transport variants of the operations are
delivered against the still-bound local Axum listener — recall
§3.4: the listener stays running, only its DID-doc advertisement is
removed. The test fixture asserts this distinction.

Total: **2× the accepted cells, plus the `UnsupportedTransport`
test.**

### 7a.4 Drain interaction matrix

Drain semantics are DIDComm-only. These are *additional* scenarios
on top of §7a.2:

| Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|
| `didcomm update` from S2 → drain set has 1 entry, 24h default TTL | drain entry exists; drain countdown visible in `drain list` |
| `didcomm update` while a previous drain is still active | drain set has 2 entries; sticky outbound routing per §3.5 |
| `didcomm disable` from S3 → drain entry created with default 24h | drain entry exists; LogEntry has no DIDComm service |
| `didcomm rollback` while drain active for the prior `update` | drain canceled, prior mediator restored, no new LogEntry chain branching |
| `didcomm rollback` of a `disable` while drain still active | DIDComm re-advertised, drain entry removed atomically |
| Drain TTL expiry → `DIDCommService::remove_listener` called | listener removed; mediator no longer in registry |
| Process restart mid-drain → drain set replayed with remaining TTL | sweeper resumes, no double-counting |
| `drain cancel <did>` on an active drain | drain entry removed immediately; listener removed |
| `--drain-ttl 0` on `disable` | no drain set; immediate listener removal (allowed only over REST transport) |
| `--drain-ttl 30s` over DIDComm transport | rejected with `DrainTtlOutOfBounds` (below `MIN_DRAIN_TTL_OVER_DIDCOMM`) |
| `--drain-ttl 31d` | rejected with `DrainTtlOutOfBounds` (above `MAX_DRAIN_TTL`) |

Total: **11 drain scenarios.**

### 7a.5 Rollback history scenarios

Rollback is history-sensitive, so it gets its own enumerated set
rather than a single state×op cell. Per §3.5a, every rollback
publishes a new LogEntry — the chain only grows.

#### DIDComm rollback

| History | Then `didcomm rollback` | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| S1 (no DIDComm history) | | `NoPriorMutation` |
| S1 → S3 (didcomm enable X) → rollback | | new LogEntry → S1 (DIDComm absent again) |
| S2 → S2 (didcomm update A→B, B draining never started since A→B drains A) → rollback | | new LogEntry → S2 with mediator A primary; B enters drain set with default 24h |
| S3 → S1 (didcomm disable from mediator A, A draining) → rollback | | new LogEntry → S3; mediator A re-pinned as primary; A's drain entry removed |
| Two consecutive didcomm updates A→B→C, then rollback | | new LogEntry → B primary; C enters drain set; A continues draining on its existing schedule (single-step rollback only) |
| S2 (no DIDComm history at all — VTA was set up REST-first then `didcomm enable`) | rollback after the enable → S2 with no DIDComm | rejected `LastServiceRefused` (would brick) |

#### REST rollback

| History | Then `rest rollback` | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| S2 (no REST history at all) | | `NoPriorMutation` |
| S2 → S3 (rest enable X) → rollback | | new LogEntry → S2 (REST absent again) |
| S3 → S3 (rest update X→Y) → rollback | | new LogEntry → S3 with REST URL X |
| S3 → S2 (rest disable from URL X) → rollback | | new LogEntry → S3 with REST URL X re-advertised |
| S1 (REST-only, no DIDComm) → rollback the most recent rest enable | | rejected `LastServiceRefused` (would brick) |

Total: **11 rollback histories** (6 DIDComm + 5 REST).

### 7a.6 Sequencing / soak paths

A handful of multi-step "operator day-in-the-life" paths to catch
state-leak bugs the cell-by-cell tests miss:

1. **Domain migration**: S3 → `rest update` → S3 (different URL) →
   verify both transports still functional, LogEntry chain has
   exactly one new entry.
2. **DIDComm-only deployment**: setup-S3 → `rest disable` → S2 →
   `didcomm update` → S2 (new mediator) → operate over DIDComm
   only for the rest of the test.
3. **REST-only deployment**: setup-S3 → `didcomm disable` → drain
   to expiry → S1 → operate over REST only.
4. **Mediator failover with rollback**: S3 → `didcomm update` to
   broken mediator → handshake fails → state still S3 with
   original mediator → `didcomm update` to good mediator →
   rollback → original restored.
5. **Restart-during-drain**: S3 → `didcomm update` → kill VTA
   process during drain window → restart → drain timers replayed
   → drain expires on schedule.
6. **Brick attempt**: S2 → `didcomm disable` → rejected
   `LastServiceRefused` → state still S2 → `rest enable` → S3 →
   `didcomm disable` → S1.

Total: **6 sequencing paths.**

### 7a.7 Test infrastructure

* All e2e tests live in `tests/e2e/` (existing crate from PR #36).
* `affinidi-messaging-test-mediator` is the DIDComm test peer
  (already on crates.io as of c0bfc30).
* Each test starts from a fresh fjall store + a freshly-set-up
  VTA in a known state — no shared state between tests.
* WebVH LogEntry chain assertions use the existing did_webvh
  helpers in `vta-service/src/operations/did_webvh/`.
* Telemetry assertions read from `RingBufferTelemetry`.

### 7a.8 Counting

Approximate test count for this matrix:

| Category | Count |
|---|---|
| §7a.2 cells × ~2 transports | ~36 |
| §7a.4 drain scenarios | 11 |
| §7a.5 rollback histories | 11 |
| §7a.6 sequencing paths | 6 |
| **Total** | **~64 e2e tests** |

This is large but tractable; the harness is shared, so most tests
are short. The matrix is the gate for shipping.

## 8. Boundaries

**Always:**
* Run `cargo fmt` before committing
* DCO-sign every commit (`git commit -s`)
* Reuse `affinidi-vc` / `affinidi-data-integrity` for any
  signed-envelope work — no hand-rolled JSON signing
* Apply `Verified*` typestate pattern to any new wire form that
  carries a signature (per CLAUDE.md)
* Update `docs/03-integrating/didcomm-protocol-management.md` and
  add a new `docs/03-integrating/runtime-service-management.md`
  operator guide

**Ask first:**
* Adding a third service kind beyond REST/DIDComm
* Changing `MAX_DRAIN_TTL` or `MIN_DRAIN_TTL_OVER_DIDCOMM`
* Adding a `--force` flag to bypass `LastServiceRefused`
* Changing the JWT audience model or adding a new claim
* Adding a new `SealedPayloadV1` variant (touch the seal helper in
  `provision_integration/seal.rs`)

**Never:**
* Provide a multi-service atomic mutation API (foot-gun)
* Allow zero advertised services
* Re-issue or rotate `verificationMethod` as a side effect of a
  service mutation
* Re-introduce `pnm mediator …` as an alias
* Bypass the existing `MODE_B_LOCK` / carve-out gating in
  TEE bootstrap
* Skip telemetry emission "because the operation is fast"

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Operator removes the only reachable transport | `LastServiceRefused` invariant; no `--force` |
| Mediator migration races with in-flight inbound | Existing drain set, sticky outbound routing |
| LogEntry publication fails after runtime mutation | Transactional rollback (existing pattern in `migrate_mediator.rs`) |
| Operator scripts break on CLI rename | Documented breaking change; user confirmed acceptable |
| 24h default surprises an operator who relied on whatever-it-was-before | No production users; one-line note in upgrade guide |
| WebVH LogEntry chain grows unbounded with frequent service mutations | Out of scope — existing chain-pruning concerns apply equally |

## 10. Resolved Questions

All previously-open questions are resolved. Audit performed on
2026-05-06 against `main` at 88dab00.

1. **DIDComm-preferred ordering:** array-ordering convention.
   The VTA DID-doc rendering function
   (`vta-service/src/operations/did_webvh/document.rs:79`) builds
   `service[]` in a fixed order. Today's order is
   mediator-didcomm → additional_services → tee-attestation.
   When REST joins the array, it goes **after** the
   DIDComm entry, preserving "DIDComm-first." No `priority` key
   is used; resolvers that walk the array in order will pick
   DIDComm first.
2. **URL reachability probing on `rest enable`:** **don't probe.**
   Trust the operator, consistent with mediator DID handling.
3. **`routing_keys` for DIDComm:** the field is already
   well-established in the mediator template
   (`vta-sdk/templates/didcomm-mediator.json:49`,
   `routingKeys`) and in
   `EnableDidcommRequest`. The current VTA `#vta-didcomm` service
   entry omits it; we'll add it as an optional pass-through when
   the operator supplies `--routing-keys`. No SDK extension
   required.
4. **`services list` JSON shape:** minimal —
   `{ kind, enabled, config: Option<…> }` per kind. Reusing
   `services report`'s telemetry-heavy shape is rejected; report
   is a different operation (per-mediator counters, sender
   last-seen).
5. **Rollback scope:** per-kind and fail-forward (§3.5a).
   `services rest rollback` and `services didcomm rollback` are
   symmetric — each publishes a new LogEntry that re-applies
   its kind's prior config.

### Implementation note — REST service entry already exists

The VTA's own DID document **already advertises** a REST service
entry today. The rendering goes through the
`additional_services` extension point of `build_did_document_inner`
rather than being baked into the inner function directly:

* `vta-service/src/setup.rs:86` — `build_vta_additional_services`
  produces a single entry:
  ```json
  {
    "id":   "{DID}#vta-rest",
    "type": "VTARest",
    "serviceEndpoint": "<public_url>"
  }
  ```
* Emitted iff `services.rest == true` AND `public_url` is set
  (matrix test in `setup.rs:175`).
* SDK resolves it via `find_service("vta-rest")` at
  `vta-sdk/src/session.rs:1100`. The resolve path is
  load-bearing for the SDK's own routing.

This **constrains** the runtime-mutation work in P1.3 / T2.4:

* **Wire shape is fixed.** Keep `id: "{DID}#vta-rest"`, keep
  `type: "VTARest"`. SDK consumers depend on these strings.
* **Rendering is moved, not invented.** P1.3 lifts the rendering
  out of `setup::build_vta_additional_services` and into the
  shared service-rendering layer, so the same JSON is emitted
  whether it comes from setup or from a runtime
  `services rest enable/update`. The setup path delegates to the
  shared layer.
* **§3.3 ordering note:** today the array is
  `[#vta-didcomm (if mediator), #vta-rest, #tee-attestation
  (if tee)]`. To honor "DIDComm preferred," the existing order is
  already correct — DIDComm is first. Confirmed in T0.1 audit
  against `document.rs:79` + `setup.rs:86`. T2.4 just locks this
  in via a render-layer test.

**Initial state post-upgrade.** An upgraded VTA with
`services.rest = true` + `public_url` set + `services.didcomm =
true` boots in **S3** (both advertised) — there is no implicit
state change from upgrade. Existing config drives the same shape
the runtime commands produce. A VTA configured today with
`services.rest = false` + `services.didcomm = false` is already
unreachable (its DID doc has no transport service entries) —
that's a pre-existing config foot-gun, not something this spec
introduces. Per §3.2, the runtime commands enforce the
"at-least-one" invariant going forward; existing misconfigured
VTAs are not auto-repaired.

* Phase 1 (this doc) — review and sign-off
* Phase 2 — Plan: component breakdown, dependency order, parallelism
* Phase 3 — Tasks: discrete units with acceptance criteria each
* Phase 4 — Implement: incremental, TDD, each task lands behind
  green CI before the next starts
