# Default `join` policy — the join ceremony decision spine
# (ceremony-pipeline design §4; supersedes the `policies.open` boolean
# shape).
#
# Join is the constructive ceremony: a DID asks to join the community.
# The submit handler verifies the VP holder-binding, assembles verified
# Facts, runs `data.vtc.join.decision`, and realizes the verdict —
# `allow` auto-admits (issues the membership credential), `refer` queues
# the request as Pending for admin review, `deny` rejects it, and
# `request_more` defers pending more evidence.
#
# Default posture: a submission presenting a **valid, trusted, unconsumed
# invitation** (VIC) auto-admits as a member — the community explicitly
# invited this DID, so no human review is needed; a submission with a
# **trusted, valid** credential also auto-admits; everything else is
# referred to the moderator queue for human review (the request lands
# Pending — the same gate the pre-pipeline `policies.open` default
# produced). Operators replace this with their own decision policy (e.g.
# admit only on an invitation, require a code-of-conduct agreement).
#
# The privilege ceiling is host-enforced around this policy: a `join`
# verdict may never grant `admin`.
