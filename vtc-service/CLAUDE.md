# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Rust workspace for **Verifiable Trust Communities (VTC)**. A VTC manages a community of Verifiable Trust Agents. Unlike the VTA (which manages keys), the VTC handles community management, ACL, audit, policy (Rego), credentials, status lists, trust-registry sync, cross-community recognition, member relationships, endorsements, the public website, and the admin SPA. Part of the [First Person Network](https://www.firstperson.network/white-paper) project.

## Workspace Structure

`vtc-service` sits inside the wider workspace at the repo root. Key sibling crates:

- **vti-common** (`../vti-common/`) — Shared library: auth (JWT, passkey), ACL, store (local fjall + vsock), audit writer + HMAC key store, error types, config, pagination cursors.
- **vta-sdk** (`../vta-sdk/`) — Shared SDK: types, VTA HTTP client, DIDComm protocol surfaces, `sealed_transfer`, provision-integration.
- **vta-service** (`../vta-service/`) — VTA library + local/dev binary (key management, did:webvh, mediator).
- **vtc-service** (this crate) — VTC binary service. Community management, policy, audit, public website, admin SPA.

`vti-common` is the canonical home for cross-crate types; VTC-specific business logic lives here.

## Key Differences from VTA

- **VTC isn't the key authority.** The VTA mints the integration DID + signing keys; the VTC stores the bundle in `secrets` and signs locally for VMC / VEC / status-list issuance (cached-locally pattern). No BIP-32 here.
- **Audience-isolated JWTs.** `aud = "VTC"`; cross-audience tokens are rejected.
- **Default port** 8200 (VTA uses 8100).
- **Twenty-odd keyspaces**, not the original two: `acl`, `sessions`, `members`, `community`, `policies`, `active_policies`, `audit`, `audit_key`, `install`, `passkey`, `status_lists`, `relationships`, `relationships_by_did`, `endorsement_types`, `endorsements`, `join_requests`, `sync_queue`, `sync_cursor`, `registry_records`, `config`, plus the website filesystem. The full live list is the keyspace fields on `AppState` in `src/server.rs`.
- **VTC never targets TEE.** Permanent non-goal (only the VTA runs in Nitro Enclave).

```

The admin SPA lives at `admin-ui/` (React + TS + Vite, baked into the binary at compile time by `build.rs` + `include_dir!`). The fallback public landing page lives at `website-default/` (plain HTML / CSS / JS, no build step).

## Operator docs

The reader-facing operator guides live under `/docs/03-vtc/`. Start there before touching code:

- `getting-started.md` — first-install walkthrough.
- `architecture.md` — keyspace + module map.
- `policy.md` — Rego authoring + activation discipline.
- `audit.md` — envelope shape, HMAC actor hashing, rotation.
- `cross-community.md` — Phase 3 recognition + trust-registry sync.
- `website-and-admin.md` — public website + admin SPA deployment.
- `admin-ui-plugins.md` — third-party plugin loader contract.

The Phase 0-5 spec is at `/docs/05-design-notes/vtc-mvp.md` — pinned decisions in §3, security invariants in §14. Section status notes flag which phase shipped each component.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build entire workspace
cargo build

# Check compilation (faster, no codegen)
cargo check

# Run the service
cargo run --package vtc-service

# Skip the admin-UI npm build during cargo invocations (faster dev loop)
VTC_SKIP_ADMIN_UI_BUILD=1 cargo build -p vtc-service

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for a single crate
cargo test --package vtc-service

# Run a single test by name
cargo test test_name

# Lint
cargo clippy

# Format
cargo fmt
cargo fmt --check   # check only
```
