    // TrustTaskRouter doesn't support per-method Trust-Task
    // selectors yet. The standalone task exists on disk +
    // index.json so the soft-gate surface stays complete.

    // cap apply; their Trust Tasks are declared there. The admin GET list keeps
    // the `/join-requests` mount here under the *same* `join-requests/submit/1.0`
    // task it has always required (axum merges this GET with the governed POST;
    // the task descriptor collapse to `submit/1.0` for the list is unchanged —
    // a per-method `list/1.0` split is future work, tracked separately).
    // Policies (Phase 2 M2.3). Three distinct Trust Tasks for the
    // three POST endpoints — upload, activate, test — so SIEM
    // filters + soft-gate consumers can target each precisely.
    // Phase 4 M4.3 + M4.4 — personhood lifecycle.
    // `members_personhood_revoke` (`members/personhood/revoke/1.0`)
    // exists on disk + in index.json so the soft-gate surface
    // stays complete, but the DELETE method shares the
    // `members/personhood/assert/1.0` mount at the router
    // layer pending per-method selectors. Same workaround as
    // `members/{did}` show + update + admin-remove.
    // Phase 4 M4.6 — VRC trust-graph endpoints.
    // Phase 4 M4.8 — endorsement type registry + custom
    // endorsement CRUD. Seven Trust Tasks total — list / show
    // / delete share their mount where TrustTaskRouter
    // doesn't yet support per-method selectors (standalone
    // tasks ship on disk + in index.json).
    // `endorsements_show` + `endorsements_revoke` share the
    // `endorsements/{id}` mount with the Trust Task header
    // pinned to the `show` variant. Standalone tasks ship on
    // disk + in index.json so the soft-gate surface stays
    // complete (same workaround as members/{did}, etc.).
    // Phase 3 M3.8 — trust-registry reconciler diagnostics.
    // Admin-gated (not super-admin) so on-call ops can read
    // queue depth + RTBF-batched + failed counts without the
    // super-admin role.
    // Phase 3 M3.10 — cross-community session mint. The Trust
    // Task declaration moved to `build_unauth_routes` so the
    // handler sits behind the tower-governor + the 64 KB body
    // cap — it's an unauthenticated endpoint that does DID
    // resolution + outbound HTTP fetch + Rego policy eval +
    // session-JWT mint, all driven by attacker-controlled VEC/VMC
    // JSON, and it was previously exposed on the 1 MB / no-rate-
    // limit main chain.
    // Read endpoints (M2.4). GET /v1/policies and
    // GET /v1/policies/{id} share their mounts with the POST
