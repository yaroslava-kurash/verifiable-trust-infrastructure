//! Credential-exchange `present` → join decision (close-the-join-loop, part 2).
//!
//! The VTA holder answers a verifier's DCQL query with an OID4VP `vp_token`
//! (the map keyed by `credential_query_id` that
//! `vta-service`'s `present_query` produces). This module is the VTC verifier's
//! decision path: it **cryptographically verifies** the `vp_token`
//! ([`crate::credentials::verify_vp_token`]), projects the verified set into the
//! ceremony [`Presentation`] evidence shape, runs the active **join** policy, and
//! realizes the verdict — auto-admitting (issuing the MembershipCredential) on
//! `allow`, else queuing / rejecting like the VP submit path.
//!
//! Unlike the VP submit path (whose `presentation.verified` rests on a
//! route-layer hex signature), here `verified` rests on the holder `kb-jwt` /
//! DI holder proof binding the verifier's `nonce` + audience — real VP
//! cryptography. [`present_and_decide_join`] takes the expected audience + nonce
//! as parameters so it is transport-agnostic; the DIDComm
//! `credential-exchange/present` handler (`messaging.rs`) sources them from the
//! single-use presentation challenge it consumes.
//!
//! This module also hosts the **query send side** ([`prepare_join_query`] +
//! [`send_query`]): the VTC issues the challenge and builds the DCQL query (from
//! a registered Accepts criterion) the holder answers.
