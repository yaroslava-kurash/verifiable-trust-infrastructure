//! `POST /v1/members/{did}/request-vmc` — ask an active member to issue and
//! send their reciprocal VMC (member → community half of the membership pair).
//!
//! Admin-triggered. The VTC sends a `members/request-vmc/1.0` DIDComm message
//! to the member's agent naming the community DID the VMC must subject; the
//! member answers asynchronously with `members/vmc/1.0` (handled by
//! [`crate::members::inbound_vmc`]). This endpoint only dispatches the request —
//! it does not block on the member's reply.
