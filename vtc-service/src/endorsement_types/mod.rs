//! Operator-uploaded endorsement type registry — Phase 4
//! M4.8.0 (D4 planning review).
//!
//! ## Why a separate keyspace
//!
//! Per planning-review D4, only registered endorsement types
//! are issuable. The issuance path (M4.8.2) consults this
//! registry at every POST — refusing unknown types with a
//! `422 endorsement-type-not-registered`. The deletion path
//! (M4.8.1) refuses to drop a type while live endorsements
//! still reference it (`409 endorsement-type-in-use`).
//!
//! Workspace-reserved types — currently only `"CommunityRole"`
//! (VEC-managed; see [`crate::credentials::vec`]) — are
//! refused at registration time so they can never enter the
//! issuance path.
