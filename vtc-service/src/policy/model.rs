//! Policy persistence model — spec §5.4 + §7.1.
//!
//! One [`Policy`] row per uploaded Rego module. Active modules are
//! pointed at by `active_policies:<purpose>` rows (single id per
//! purpose). M2.2 lands the model + storage CRUD; the upload /
//! activate / test endpoints layer on top in M2.3.
//!
//! ## What's stored, what's recompiled
//!
//! Spec §5.4 + plan §D3: only the Rego **source** + its **SHA-256**
//! hit fjall. Compiled bytecode is reconstructed at boot by walking
//! the active-pointer set and re-compiling. This keeps the on-disk
//! shape stable across regorus upgrades — bumping the interpreter
//! never invalidates stored rows.
//!
//! ## Wire shape vs storage shape
//!
//! The serialized form (`camelCase`) is also the JSON shape returned
//! by `GET /v1/policies/{id}` (M2.4). The audit envelope's
//! `PolicyActivated` data struct lifts `id` + `purpose` + `sha256` +
//! `version` from this same struct — see vti-common audit events.
//!
//! Phase 2 milestones layered on top:
//! - M2.3 — upload + activate + test endpoints.
//! - M2.5 — bundled default policies (join, removal, personhood, …)
//!   land as [`Policy`] rows at boot if no row exists for the
//!   purpose.
//! - M2.6 / M2.7 — `join.rego` + `removal.rego` consume the active
//!   pointer.
//! - M2.17 — audit variants `PolicyUploaded` + `PolicyActivated`
//!   reference [`Policy::id`] / [`Policy::sha256`].
