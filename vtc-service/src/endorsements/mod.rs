//! Custom endorsement credentials — Phase 4 M4.7 + M4.8.
//! Spec §6.1 "Custom endorsement" row.
//!
//! ## What this module owns
//!
//! - `Endorsement` — the persisted row recording a custom
//!   endorsement issued by an Issuer-role member (or admin)
//!   for a subject. Stored in the `endorsements:` keyspace
//!   keyed by UUID.
//! - Storage helpers: round-trip, list (paginated), mark
//!   revoked, find live-by-type.
//! - **Live-by-type check** is load-bearing for the type
//!   registry deletion path (M4.8.1) — operators can't drop a
//!   type while live endorsements still exist.
//!
//! Per planning-review D4, the *type registry* itself lives
//! in [`crate::endorsement_types`] — only registered URIs
//! are issuable. The endorsements module here trusts that
//! invariant; the route layer enforces it at issue time.
