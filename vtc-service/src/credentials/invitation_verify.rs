//! Verify a presented **Invitation Credential** (VIC) at join time — the
//! verification half of the VIC auto-join ceremony (the issuance half is
//! [`super::invitation`]).
//!
//! [`verify_presented_invitation`] pulls the `InvitationCredential` out of a
//! submitted VP, cryptographically verifies its issuer Data-Integrity proof
//! (resolving the issuer DID through the shared [`DidVmResolver`]), and resolves
//! the host-side facts the join policy decides over:
//!
//! - **holder-binding** — the VIC's `credentialSubject.id` must be the
//!   applicant presenting it (a VIC minted for someone else can't be replayed);
//! - **temporal validity** — `validFrom <= now < validUntil`;
//! - **revocation** — the VIC's status-list bit must be clear;
//! - **issuer trust** — is the issuer the community itself (M1 self-issued) or a
//!   registry-recognised third party (M2)? Surfaced as `issuer_trusted`.
//!
//! It returns a [`VerifiedInvitation`] — the workspace's verified-wire-form
//! typestate. The only way to obtain one is to pass every check above, so a call
//! site cannot feed an unverified invitation into the policy. Authenticity
//! failures (bad proof, wrong subject, expired, revoked) are a hard
//! [`AppError::Forbidden`] that never reaches policy; **consumption** is left as
//! a *policy fact* (`Invitation.consumed`) the host attaches separately, so the
//! single-use rule is the policy's call (`has_valid_invitation` rejects a
//! consumed invite) rather than a silent abort.
