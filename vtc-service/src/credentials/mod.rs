//! Credentials issued by the VTC — Phase 2 M2.9.
//!
//! Spec §6.1's DTG catalog. This module covers the two
//! credentials Phase 2 mints from a member-side action:
//!
//! - **VMC** ([`vmc`]) — Verifiable Membership Credential. One per
//!   member, re-minted on join + every renewal. Bounded
//!   `validUntil` per spec §3-F.
//! - **VEC** ([`vec`]) — Verifiable Endorsement Credential, used
//!   for role grants (`endorsement = { type: "CommunityRole",
//!   role, communityDid }`). Re-issued on every role change.
//!
//! Both are signed locally via [`LocalSigner`] — plan §D1's
//! "cached-locally, VTA-controlled" model. The VTC's `#key-0`
//! Ed25519 secret already lives in the secret store; no per-call
//! VTA round-trip.
//!
//! ## Why M2.9 is one PR-sized module
//!
//! The two credential builders share their signing path,
//! validity-window plumbing, and `@context`-URL handling. They
//! also share their test-fixture pattern (deterministic seed →
//! known issuer DID + verify the proof with the matching
//! public key). Keeping the surface together means the M2.12
//! issuance step (VMC + VEC on approve) and the M2.13 renewal
//! step both reach for one canonical module.
//!
//! ## Shape parity with `vta-sdk::provision_integration::credential`
//!
//! The reference implementation in the VTA SDK signs a
//! `VtaAuthorizationCredential` the same way: `CredentialBuilder`
//! → `DataIntegrityProof::sign(&vc, &secret, …)` → attach proof.
//! We follow that pattern verbatim so the workspace has exactly
//! one canonical way to sign a VC.
//!
//! ## Status-list credentialStatus
//!
//! The VMC builder accepts an optional [`CredentialStatusRef`].
//! When present, the VMC carries a `credentialStatus` block
//! pointing at the relevant BitstringStatusList entry. M2.9
//! lands the *shape*; M2.10 + M2.11 populate the URL +
//! index from a live status-list registry. M2.9 alone can be
//! exercised with the optional left as `None` — the resulting
//! VMC has no `credentialStatus`, which is the expected
//! pre-status-list state in tests.
