//! Deliver issued credentials to a holder's wallet over DIDComm.
//!
//! When the VTC issues a credential to a member — at join auto-admit, at
//! admin-approve, or when a role change re-mints the role VEC — the holder needs
//! to actually *receive* it. The REST surfaces return the credential inline in
//! their response (for out-of-band hand-off), but a holder that interacted over
//! DIDComm, or one that's offline at approval/role-change time, has no inline
//! channel. This module pushes each credential to the holder over DIDComm.
//!
//! Each credential is wrapped in a `credential-exchange/issue` message — the same
//! one-way-deposit shape the holder's VTA receives via its
//! `handle_credential_issue` handler — packed authcrypt **to the proven holder**
//! (never the relayer) and forwarded via the holder's own mediator (resolved from
//! its DID document, falling back to the VTC's mediator for the shared-mediator
//! deployment). Sending is **best-effort**: the credential is already issued and
//! persisted, so the caller logs a delivery failure rather than unwinding the
//! decision.
