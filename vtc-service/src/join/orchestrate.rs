//! The join-submit orchestration spine — holder-binding verification, the
//! decide -> auto-admit-effect -> audit pipeline, and the join-request
//! persistence — moved out of `routes/join_requests/submit.rs` (P2.1) so it
//! lives beside the join lifecycle it drives (`crate::join`) and is shared by
//! every entry point (REST submit, DIDComm, credential-exchange present)
//! without a `crate::routes::...` back-reference. The route handler keeps only
//! the wire body/response types + auth extraction.
//!
//! Also hosts `emit_admit_audit` (the `MemberAdded` + `VmcIssued` + `VecIssued`
//! envelopes a member admission records) — shared with the manual-approve route
//! (`routes::join_requests::decide::approve`).
