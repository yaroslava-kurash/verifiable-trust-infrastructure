//! Member domain model — spec §5.2.
//!
//! ## Why a separate keyspace from `acl:`
//!
//! Plan §D3: `acl:<did>` (auth-gate) and `members:<did>`
//! (community-membership metadata) are 1:1 by DID but logically
//! distinct. The auth path reads ACL rows on every request and
//! shouldn't pay the cost of loading the richer Member metadata.
//! Lifecycle is matched — creating a Member is always atomic with
//! writing the ACL row, and removal is similarly paired — so the
//! per-DID consistency invariant is upheld inside the same fjall
//! transaction.
//!
//! ## What's deferred to Phase 2+
//!
//! Spec §5.2's `status_list_index`, `current_vmc_id`, and
//! `current_role_vec_id` are credential pointers populated by
//! Phase 2's VTA-oracle issuance flow. They ship as `Option<T>`
//! slots from day one so Phase 2 can populate them without a
//! migration; Phase 1 always writes `None`.
//!
//! Spec §10.1's `Disposition` enum carries
//! `PolicyDefault` which (per plan §D6) resolves to `Tombstone`
//! in Phase 1 until `removal.rego` lands in Phase 2. The
//! `Disposition` enum is defined here so the value is on the wire
//! from day one; the resolver indirection lives at the removal
//! call site.
