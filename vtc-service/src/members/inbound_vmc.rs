//! Receive + verify a member-issued **VMC** (member → community half of the
//! membership pair) and record it on the member's row.
//!
//! The VTC issues a `MembershipCredential` to each member at
//! admission; this is the reciprocal the member issues back, naming the
//! community as its `credentialSubject`. The `eddsa-jcs-2022` issuer proof (key
//! under the member's DID, resolved via [`DidVmResolver`] so `did:webvh`
//! personas verify, not just `did:key`) IS the authentication of the
//! credential. Over DIDComm the authcrypt sender independently authenticates
//! `member_did`; the two must agree.
//!
//! Shared by the DIDComm `members/vmc/1.0` handler (the only transport today —
//! members speak DIDComm).
