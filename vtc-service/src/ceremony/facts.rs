//! The Facts contract — the purpose-agnostic policy `input` every
//! ceremony shares (ceremony-pipeline design §3).
//!
//! One typed shape feeds every `<purpose>.rego` module. It is the
//! greenfield replacement for the MVP's lossy
//! [`crate::policy::extract::extract_vp_claims`] projection: instead
//! of handing the policy a flattened `vp_claims` blob, the host hands
//! it **structured, pre-verified facts** — `actor` / `subject` /
//! `context` / `evidence` / `state`. Crypto (signatures,
//! holder-binding, revocation, issuer-trust) is resolved by the host
//! *before* a [`Facts`] is ever assembled (see
//! [`crate::ceremony::verify`]); the policy therefore reasons only
//! over booleans + claims, never over a signature.
//!
//! ## Wire shape is load-bearing
//!
//! These structs serialize to the exact JSON the Rule-IR-compiled
//! Rego reads — `snake_case` keys, `evidence.presentation.
//! credentials[].issuer_trusted`, `state.subject_member`, and so on.
//! The runnable policies under
//! `docs/05-design-notes/examples/*.rego` are the ground truth for
//! field names; the round-trip tests at the bottom of this module
//! lock the serialized shape against those examples. Renaming a field
//! here silently breaks every compiled policy that reads it, so the
//! `#[serde(rename = …)]` / `rename_all` attributes are part of the
//! contract, not cosmetic.
//!
//! ## Optionality convention
//!
//! - Evidence slots a ceremony doesn't use are **absent**
//!   (`skip_serializing_if`), not `null` — `directory` facts carry
//!   only `evidence.request`. Rego treats absent + `null` identically
//!   (both `undefined`), so the compiled helpers (`cred_trusted`,
//!   `has_valid_invitation`, …) defend against both.
//! - `state.subject_member` is the one slot serialized as explicit
//!   `null` when empty (an unknown DID joining has no member row) —
//!   the design example shows it present-but-null, and policies read
//!   `input.state.subject_member` directly.
