//! The ceremony decision pipeline — one pipeline, every community
//! state transition an instance of it.
//!
//! Design: `docs/05-design-notes/vtc-ceremony-pipeline.md` (with the
//! catalog, Rule-IR, and protocol companions). The thesis: a
//! community has many governed transitions — joining, leaving, role
//! changes, directory queries — that share one shape:
//!
//! ```text
//! TRIGGER → GATHER → VERIFY (host) → FACTS → EVALUATE (<purpose>.rego)
//!         → VERDICT → EFFECTS (<purpose>)
//! ```
//!
//! Everything expensive to build — verification, the verdict model,
//! versioning, governance, the visual authoring compiler — is built
//! once here and inherited by every ceremony, rather than wired
//! bespoke per purpose as in the MVP.
//!
//! ## What this module contains (pipeline stage A — the spine)
//!
//! - [`facts`] — the purpose-agnostic [`Facts`] contract (the typed
//!   policy `input`), replacing the MVP's lossy `vp_claims`.
//! - [`verdict`] — the four-valued [`Verdict`] (`allow` / `deny` /
//!   `refer` / `request_more`), replacing the MVP's boolean.
//! - [`verify`] — the [`VerifiedFacts`] typestate: the gate that
//!   guarantees the policy only ever sees verified facts.
//! - [`evaluate`] — runs a purpose's policy over verified facts and
//!   parses the decision, with a host structural-totality backstop.
//! - [`invariant`] — the host-enforced hard guards a policy can't
//!   override (privilege ceiling, step-up); applied after evaluate.
//! - [`decide`] — the `evaluate → invariant` driver that turns a
//!   [`VerifiedFacts`] + the purpose's policy into a final
//!   [`Verdict`].
//! - [`effects`] — plans the per-purpose state change a verdict
//!   authorizes ([`effects::EffectPlan`]). The directory projection
//!   (read-only) is fully realized; the write plans (admit / depart /
//!   re-mint) are typed intents the executor applies.
//! - [`execute`] — the async effect executor ([`execute::apply`]):
//!   applies a plan against `AppState`. The **Admit** (join) write
//!   path is wired and is the op the manual approve route now goes
//!   through; **Depart** / **Remint** await their ceremonies.
//!
//! Still to land on top of this spine (pipeline §11): the Depart /
//! Remint executor arms (with their leave / role-change ceremonies)
//! and the remaining state-dependent invariant — no-last-admin (see
//! [`invariant`]).
//!
//! ## Relationship to the existing `policy` + `join` modules
//!
//! This is the greenfield pipeline; [`crate::policy`] (the regorus
//! engine plus persistence) is **reused** underneath it — `Verdict`
//! parses the decision object [`crate::policy::engine::evaluate`]
//! returns.
//! The MVP's bespoke [`crate::join`] flow and its `vp_claims`
//! projection are what this pipeline supersedes; they remain in place
//! until ceremonies are ported over (build-vs-reuse map, pipeline
//! §10).
