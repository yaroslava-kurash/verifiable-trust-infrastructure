//! The pre-verification typestate — [`VerifiedFacts`]
//! (ceremony-pipeline design §2 "Verify", §9).
//!
//! The pipeline's load-bearing invariant: **crypto lives entirely in
//! the Verify stage, so the policy reasons only over a verified
//! view.** This module is where that becomes a *type*, not a
//! convention. The evaluate stage takes a [`VerifiedFacts`], which can
//! only be produced by running raw [`Facts`] through
//! [`VerifiedFacts::assemble`]. A call site that tries to evaluate
//! un-verified facts doesn't compile — it has a [`Facts`], not a
//! [`VerifiedFacts`].
//!
//! This generalizes the MVP's `VerifiedJoinRequest` (`vtc-mvp.md`
//! §10.1) from one ceremony to all of them, per the build-vs-reuse
//! map (pipeline §10: "generalize `VerifiedJoinRequest` →
//! `VerifiedFacts`").
//!
//! ## What "verified" means here
//!
//! The per-evidence cryptography — VP proof checking, holder-binding,
//! invitation-signature verification, status-list resolution,
//! issuer-trust via TRQP — is performed by the host *upstream* and
//! recorded into the `verified` / `issuer_trusted` / `status` fields
//! of [`Facts`]. [`VerifiedFacts::assemble`] is the **gate** that
//! refuses to let facts reach the policy unless every evidence slot
//! the actor presented actually carries a passing `verified` verdict.
//! An authenticity failure aborts here and never reaches policy — the
//! design's "identity/authenticity failure → abort (never reach
//! policy)" edge.
//!
//! What this gate deliberately does **not** do: re-run the crypto
//! (that's the host's job, upstream), or judge a credential's
//! `status` / `issuer_trusted` (those are *facts the policy decides
//! on*, not authenticity preconditions — a revoked-but-genuinely-
//! verified credential is a valid fact for a policy to reject).
