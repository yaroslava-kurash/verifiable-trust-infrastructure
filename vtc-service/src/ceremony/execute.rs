//! The Effects executor — apply an [`EffectPlan`] against `AppState`
//! (ceremony-pipeline design §5, the "apply" half of the effect
//! stage).
//!
//! [`super::effects::plan`] produced a typed *intent*; this is where
//! that intent becomes state. It is the **only** stage that mutates
//! community state, and it is driven solely by the verdict-derived
//! plan. The pure decision spine (verify → evaluate → invariant →
//! decide → plan) is all testable without I/O; this module is the
//! single I/O seam.
//!
//! ## Single entry point, shared by the bespoke flow
//!
//! [`apply`] is the one executor. The MVP's manual join-approve route
//! ([`crate::routes::join_requests::decide::approve`]) is refactored
//! to go through it too — it builds an [`EffectPlan::Admit`] and calls
//! [`apply`], so the pipeline genuinely supersedes the bespoke write
//! path rather than duplicating it. The approve route's integration
//! tests therefore exercise the [`EffectPlan::Admit`] arm end-to-end.
//!
//! ## What's wired
//!
//! - **Admit** (join) — write the ACL row + Member record, issue the
//!   VMC + role VEC, flip the status-list slot. Fully wired; the
//!   manual approve route goes through it.
//! - **Depart** (leave) — enforce the no-last-admin invariant, delete
//!   the ACL row, apply the disposition to the Member row, and revoke
//!   the credential (flip the revocation bit). Fully wired; the
//!   `DELETE /v1/members/{me,did}` removal routes go through it.
//! - **Remint** (role-change) — change the ACL role in place + re-mint
//!   the role VEC, enforcing no-last-admin on demotion. Fully wired;
//!   the `PATCH /v1/members/{did}` role change goes through it.
//! - **NoStateChange** (deny / refer / request_more) — no-op.
//! - **Project** (directory) — not handled here: the directory route
//!   serializes the projection into its HTTP response inline, so a
//!   `Project` plan reaching the executor is a caller bug.
