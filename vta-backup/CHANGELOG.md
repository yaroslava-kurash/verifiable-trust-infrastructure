## [0.7.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.6.1...vta-backup-v0.7.0) — 2026-09-27


### Added

- **webvh**: Reach the DID hosting service with Trust Tasks only ([#1789](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1789))

* feat(webvh)!: reach the DID hosting service with Trust Tasks only

  Stage 2b of the webvh-service Trust Tasks plan (trust-tasks #661). The
  VTA's REST client to the hosting service and WebvhTransport::Rest are
  removed; one client, vta-service/src/webvh_host.rs, makes every call as a
  Trust Task typed with the generated did-management bindings, over the
  transport the seam picks (TSP > DIDComm > HTTPS POST {base}/trust-tasks).

  - The HTTPS base defaults to {WebVHHosting origin}/api, where the hosting
    service serves its binding; https:// only, or http:// to loopback.
  - Every reply must carry the host's proof (SignedByRecipient), thread to
    the request, be addressed to this VTA and have the asked-for type.
    Refusals are read from trust-task-error documents by spec code;
    did/problem-report is no longer read.
  - servers/domains reads me/domains; reconcile and retire-orphan read the
    paged did/list {records, total} and now work over Trust Tasks. A listing
    that disagrees with its total is refused.
  - The DID-auth handshake, the server-auth token cache, WebvhAuthLocks and
    the WebVHHostingService alias are gone. vta-webvh is the store only.

  The test hosting service is now a Trust-Task host that refuses unsigned
  requests and signs its answers; a forged answer is refused.

- **sdk**: Remove the last legacy backup and webvh surfaces; realign-keys is a Trust Task ([#1783](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1783))

* feat!: remove the last legacy backup and webvh surfaces; realign-keys is a Trust Task

  Every remote API is a spine-dispatched Trust Task over TSP, DIDComm and
  HTTPS. What was left off the spine on these two surfaces was deprecated,
  and most of it could no longer succeed anywhere. Test deployments carry no
  compat, so it is deleted rather than refused.

  Backup
  - SDK `backup_export`, `backup_import`, `backup_import_with` (deprecated
    since 0.21.3 / 0.49.0), the `backup-management/1.0` message constants, and
    `ExportRequest` / `ImportRequest`.
  - `pnm backup {export,import} --use-rest-legacy`. It could not work on any
    transport: the VTA answered 403 over REST (VTI-VTA-003), and the SDK's
    `rpc` refuses DIDComm and TSP. Its doc said "works only over DIDComm".
  - The VTA's `POST /backup/{export,import}` and the VTC's
    `POST /v1/backup/{export,import}`, which only ever answered 403. A backup
    is the `vta/backup/*` (VTA) or `vtc/backup/export` + `backup/*` (VTC) Trust
    Tasks, over an end-to-end transport only; that policy is unchanged.

  webvh
  - SDK `update_did_webvh` / `rotate_did_webvh_keys` (the `(context, scid)`
    forms, deprecated since 0.20.32) and their message constants. The by-DID
    `update_did_webvh_by_did` / `rotate_did_webvh_keys_by_did` are the only
    forms.
  - The VTA's `POST /contexts/{ctx}/dids/{scid}/{update,rotate-keys}` and
    `POST /webvh/dids/{did}/realign-keys`.
  - `realign_did_webvh_keys` was REST-only "deliberately". The reason was out of
    date: the VTA already dispatched `webvh/dids/realign-keys/1.0`. The SDK now
    sends the task, so `pnm did-mgmt dids realign-keys` works over TSP and
    DIDComm too.

  Tests
  - The REST behaviour tests for update and rotate (metadata-only update,
    document update, rotate, unknown DID, invalid document) are ported to
    `/trust-tasks`. The removed routes are held gone.
  - The webvh REST-parity consent test is dropped. The Trust Task consent path
    it compared against is covered by the rest of `delegated_consent_e2e`.
  - `mock_vta` drives the by-DID update.



## [0.6.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.6.0...vta-backup-v0.6.1) — 2026-09-26


## [0.6.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.5.3...vta-backup-v0.6.0) — 2026-09-26


### Changed

- **vti-common**: Move the node-neutral backup transfer core out of vta-backup ([#1641](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1641)) ([#1721](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1721))

The community node needs the backup transfer the agent already has. A VTC
  backup, like any real node's, is too large for one Trust Task document, and the
  node-neutral `backup/*` family (trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#633, released
  in trust-tasks-rs 0.22.7) is how it moves: a bundle, a manifest committed before
  any byte moves, chunks pulled and pushed by index, a finalize that checks the
  assembled bytes before trusting them.

  `vta-backup` implements all of that for `vta/backup/*`, but the VTC cannot
  depend on it — it pulls `vta-config`, `vta-keys`, `vta-support` and `vta-webvh`.
  Only a thin layer of it is the agent's: serializing the agent's state into an
  envelope, and applying one. The rest never asked what a bundle contains.

  So that rest moves to `vti_common::backup_transfer`, which both nodes already
  depend on for storage and auth:

  - `bundle_store` — the `BundleRecord` state machine, token minting and the
    constant-time token check (was `vta_backup::backup_bundle_store`);
  - `sweeper` — TTL expiry and retention (was `vta_backup::backup_bundle_sweeper`);
  - `chunked` — staging, the chunk plan, `get_chunk`, `initiate_import`,
    `put_chunk`, `finalize_precheck` and the per-DID rate limiter (was
    `vta_backup::ops::chunked`), plus `check_initiate` and a node-neutral chunked
    `complete_export`;
  - the ownership, kind, TTL and open-bundle-cap rules, and `abort`, from
    `vta_backup::ops::descriptors`.

  Files moved with `git mv`, so their history follows them. `vta-backup`
  re-exports every moved module under its old path, keeps `initiate_export`
  (which serializes the agent's state and hands the bytes to `stage_export`), and
  routes `abort_bundle` through the shared `abort`. No behaviour changes, and no
  public path in `vta-backup` disappears.

  `vti-common` gains `subtle`, and now declares the tokio `fs` and `io-util`
  features the moved code uses. `vta-backup` had used `tokio::fs` without
  declaring `fs`, building only by feature unification.

  The 32 moved tests run in `vti-common`, and `vta-backup`'s own suite (54) is
  unchanged. The VTC's `backup/*` handlers follow in the next change.



### Fixed

- **vta-service**: Apply the key-export and sign capability checks on every transport ([#1733](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1733))

* fix(vta-service): apply the key-export and sign capability checks on every transport

  The KeyExport capability was checked only by the keys/export-secret
  Trust-Task handler, so GET /keys/{id}/secret and DIDComm get-key-secret
  released private keys to an admin whose entry was narrowed without
  key-export. Capability::Sign was checked nowhere.

  Both checks now live in the operation layer (VTI-VTA-003, VTI-VTA-007):

  - get_key_secret requires key-export before any lookup, refuses a
    hop-by-hop channel (keys/export-secret/0.1 requires a channel
    confidential to the two parties), keeps the internal-key and
    non-exportable refusals, and writes the key.secret_export audit row
    durably before releasing the material, refusing if it cannot.
  - The Trust-Task binding (https, didcomm, tsp) is recorded at the three
    entry points and named in the export's audit channel.
  - vta/contexts/secrets and provision-integration use the same gate.
  - sign_payload requires sign for opaque caller bytes; derive-and-sign
    and derive-and-sign-document require sign.
  - The legacy REST and DIDComm key routes now consult the policy gate
    with the matching Trust-Task URI.
  - The TEE mnemonic export writes a durable audit row before release.



### Security

- **resolver**: One bounded DID-document cache per node, re-resolved once before a verification fails (VTI-KEY-134) ([#1737](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1737))

* security(resolver)!: one bounded DID-document cache per node, re-resolved once before a verification fails (VTI-KEY-134)

  The VTC ran two DID-document caches: the app resolver built in
  `init_auth`, and a second one the messaging TDK built for itself
  because it was given none. Both used the SDK defaults of a 300 s TTL and
  100 entries. Every DIDComm and TSP message on the mediator socket was
  checked against a cache the REST and Trust Task paths could not see or
  evict. Neither cache was ever refreshed when a verification failed, so
  a peer that rotated was refused as a forger until its entry aged out.

  Bounded TTL (key-roles, dtgwg-vti-spec #42: VTI-KEY-060/062/122/123/134):

  - A new `[did_cache]` section (`vti_common::config::DidCacheConfig`)
    holds `ttl_secs` (default 60, refused outside 1..=300) and `capacity`
    (default 1000). The VTA and the VTC read the same type.
  - The TTL is what bounds how long a key revoked for compromise keeps
    verifying: VTI-KEY-123 allows no overlap, and nothing else notices a
    removal. A new key does not wait on the TTL, because of the refresh
    below. 60 s caps the revocation window at a minute, for one resolution
    per active DID per minute. 300 s, the SDK default and the old
    behaviour, is the ceiling.
  - `vta_sdk::resolver::build_verifier_did_cache_config` builds it, with
    the webvh host policy the VTA already used. The VTC now uses that
    policy too, so the private-host opt-in reaches it as well.

  One cache:

  - The VTC messaging TDK is handed the app resolver.
  - The VTA already shared its resolver. Its fallback when there is no
    app resolver now gets the same bounds, not the SDK defaults.

  Re-resolve once, then fail closed (`vta_sdk::did_refresh`):

  - `resolve_for_vm`: when a cached document does not list the method a
    proof names, re-resolve it fresh once. This covers every Trust Task
    proof on both nodes (`TrustTaskVmResolver`) and the VTC credential/VP
    resolver (`DidVmResolver`).
  - `verify_trust_task_proof_with`: when verification fails and the
    signer's document came from the cache, evict it and verify once more.
    This covers a key id kept with its material replaced.
  - `unpack_refreshing_sender`: when an authcrypt unpack fails, evict the
    sender named in the protected header (`skid`) and retry once. It is
    used on the REST DIDComm auth and refresh paths of both nodes.
  - Each forced refresh is rate-limited per DID (5 s, with at most 4096
    DIDs tracked). A failing proof is something anyone can send, and
    without the limit each one would make this node fetch a third party's
    document.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.4.7...vta-backup-v0.5.0) — 2026-09-22


### Added

- **backup**: A backup is the whole agent, and restores between plain, hardened and TEE VTAs ([#1655](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1655))

A backup now carries every row of every keyspace in vta_keyspaces::BACKED_UP
  (format vta-backup-v2) and restores into a plain, hardened or Nitro-enclave
  VTA from any of them. VTI-VTA-001, VTI-VTA-050, VTI-VTA-051, VTI-KEY-033.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.3.10...vta-backup-v0.4.0) — 2026-09-16


### Added

- **backup**: Back up a DIDComm/TSP-only VTA with the chunkedTrustTask algorithm ([#1522](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1522))

* build(deps): trust-tasks-rs 0.21.1, the release carrying the chunked backup specs

  0.21.1 is the first release with `vta/backup/get-chunk/1.0`,
  `put-chunk/1.0`, `initiate-{export,import}/1.1` and
  `finalize-import/1.1` (trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#474). A
  dispatched URI the registry has no schema for fails
  `every_served_uri_has_a_published_spec_or_is_tracked_debt`, so the floor
  moves with the tasks that need it.



## [0.3.10](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.3.9...vta-backup-v0.3.10) — 2026-09-16


### Fixed

- **backup**: Typed refusals for backup on a DIDComm/TSP-only VTA ([#1516](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1516))

The descriptor flow (`pnm backup export|import`) is REST-only: its
  `stream` algorithm moves the bytes over the VTA's HTTPS blob endpoint.
  A DIDComm/TSP-only VTA could not be backed up remotely, and every layer
  reported that badly.

  - SDK: `post_trust_task` refused DIDComm/TSP clients with `Validation`
    ("your request is wrong") although the same request succeeds over
    REST. It now returns `VtaError::UnsupportedTransport` naming
    `--transport rest`, as do `download_blob`/`upload_blob` when a client
    has no REST leg (their 429 → `RateLimited` mapping is unchanged). A
    DIDComm client's `rest_url` is still not used: it can come from the
    caller rather than from an advertised `VTARest` service, and the flow
    must not downgrade past what the peer advertises.
  - Server: a VTA with no `public_url` answered `initiate-*` with an opaque
    `internalError`, after already staging the bundle. It now refuses up
    front with the code `vta/backup/initiate-{export,import}/1.0` declare,
    `<slug>:transportUnavailable`, and the client maps that to
    `UnsupportedTransport`.
  - CLI: `--use-rest-legacy` on a DIDComm client silently sent the whole
    envelope as one mediator message (refused above 1 MiB, seen as a
    timeout). It now warns with the size caveat and `--transport rest`.
    Import no longer uploads the bytes twice: the commit finalizes the
    previewed bundle (new `VtaClient::backup_finalize_import`), and
    re-uploads only when the slot was already collected (not-found). A
    conflict is surfaced rather than retried, because it may mean "already
    committed" and commit is not idempotent.
  - retry_safety: initiate-export's reply carries the secret
    `transportToken`, not complete-export's; the classifications were
    swapped to match (initiate-export → KeyedSecret, complete-export →
    Keyed) so the token is never cached in the dedup store.
  - Docs: stale status line, non-existent offline `vta backup` command,
    the appstate note's claim that blobs work for DIDComm clients, the SDK
    "works on every transport" claim, and an operator note on backup for a
    DIDComm/TSP-only VTA. The planned transfer algorithm is renamed
    `chunkedTrustTask` (SPEC §4.10 casing) and specified upstream in
    trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#474.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.2.0...vta-backup-v0.3.0) — 2026-08-28


### Chore

- **deps**: Aes-gcm 0.11, and stop the nonce conversions panicking ([#1173](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1173))
- **sdk**: Release vta-sdk 0.30.0 for the added CreateKeyBody field ([#1156](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1156))

`CreateKeyBody` gained a `key_id` field while the crate stayed at 0.29.0.
  The struct is exhaustively constructible through the public API, so an
  existing literal no longer compiles — a breaking change under 0.x rules,
  which the semver report has been flagging as its one real finding
  (195 pass, 1 fail) since the field landed.

  Bumps the crate and the nineteen intra-workspace requirements that pin it,
  so `cargo check --workspace` still resolves the path copy and a consumer
  resolving from the registry gets a version that admits the break.



## [0.2.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.14...vta-backup-v0.2.0) — 2026-08-26


### Added

- **app-state**: A third store for versioned, namespaced application state ([#1051](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1051))

Applications built on a VTA have had nowhere to keep versioned metadata.
  Adds `vta/app-state/{get,put,list,delete,get-many,put-many}/1.0` — a store
  beside the secrets vault and the credential vault, for JSON an application
  owns and the VTA does not interpret.

  Records are addressed `(contextId, namespace, key)`. The namespace scopes one
  application so several tools can share a context without colliding, and is the
  seam a per-namespace grant would later use — which is why it is part of the
  address rather than a prefix convention on the key. In 1.0 a namespace is
  collision avoidance and NOT a trust boundary: an application with write access
  to a context reaches every namespace in it, and the `put` and `delete` specs
  say so normatively. Isolation means separate contexts.

  Deliberately not built on `vta/memory/*`. `MemoryItem` is `{key, value}` with
  nothing to hang a precondition on, and its `list` returns the whole context —
  but the argument that settles it is that "forget everything" has to stay a safe
  thing to ask an agent, which it cannot be if account state lives there.

  Three properties are why this is a store rather than a field on an existing one.

  **One counter per `(contextId, namespace)`, not per record.** A record's
  `version` is the counter value its most recent write took, so one number is
  simultaneously the optimistic-concurrency token `expectedVersion` compares
  against and the watermark `sinceVersion` compares against. A per-record counter
  serves the first but cannot serve the second — two records' counters are not
  comparable, so no single number means "everything after this point" — and would
  have forced a second sequence kept consistent by hand. The cost is that a
  record's version jumps by whatever its neighbours consumed, which the wire
  contract states: versions are opaque and monotonic, never an edit count.

  **A failed precondition returns the current version AND value.** A bare
  rejection obliges a re-read, and the re-read races the next write; the pattern
  has no fixed point under contention. Returning the winner's view removes the
  race rather than narrowing it, and the spec makes it normative.

  **Delete leaves a versioned tombstone, and the tombstones are reaped.** Without
  one, a consumer pulling from a watermark learns of every create and update and
  never of a deletion, so deleted records resurrect on its next rebuild.
  Retention is `app_state.tombstone_retention_days` (default 30, matching the
  vault's `grace_days`) — a destructive window is an operator's choice, not a
  constant — and `list` advertises the configured value, since a consumer
  schedules against that number. The sweeper runs from the storage thread beside
  the ACL/consent/vault sweepers.

  The sweeper reaps a *prefix*, not a set: each namespace walks its tombstones in
  version order and stops at the first still inside the window. Reaping a later
  tombstone while leaving an earlier one would make the reap watermark
  unstateable — no single number would describe what survives, which is precisely
  what `watermarkTooOld` has to be able to say. `0` days disables reaping, and
  that is enforced at the call site rather than as a zero cutoff, which would mean
  the opposite.

  Version reservation is fsynced and re-seals the TEE integrity manifest, for the
  reason `vti_common::store::counter` gives for BIP-32 counters: a counter
  surviving only in the journal buffer can be re-derived after a crash and reissue
  a used value. Here a reused version means two records collide on one `appv:`
  index key, so one disappears from the change feed and every incremental consumer
  misses that change permanently, silently. A batch reserves a block and pays one
  fsync rather than N; writes that then fail leave gaps, which are safe and
  tested.

  Retry safety: reads are `ReadOnly`, `delete` is `RetrySafe` (a second delete
  finds a tombstone and deliberately takes no new version, so a watcher sees
  nothing), and `put`/`put-many` are `Keyed` — a `put` without `expectedVersion`
  does not converge, and the class is per URI, not per payload.

  Blobs are deliberately out of scope in 1.0; adding a `blobRef` is additive.

  Concurrency is a process-local lock per namespace, not a store-layer
  compare-and-swap. fjall takes an exclusive database lock so two processes cannot
  share a store, and the vsock protocol has no atomic opcode — its
  `insert_if_absent`/`swap` are already non-atomic fallbacks. A CAS today would be
  atomic exactly where the lock suffices and a warn-and-fallback exactly where it
  would need to be real. Recorded in the design note with what would change that.

  Schemas published upstream as trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#252 and #253;
  this depends on the released trust-tasks-rs 0.11.2, pinned to a minimum patch so
  an older resolve fails as a stale dependency rather than as unspecced URIs.
  Conformance witnesses cover all six URIs, so nothing enters
  `UNSPECCED_DISPATCHED_URIS`.



### Fixed

- **vtc**: Follow the spec on every auth response, and close the conformance gate ([#1112](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1112))

* test(vtc)!: make response conformance fail the build

  Until now the layer reported and a green suite was not evidence of
  conformance — #1107's own memory note said to grep the run rather than trust
  the exit code, which is a signal nobody has to obey.

  A violation outside the allowlist now returns 500 with the schema error, so the
  test that provoked it fails on its own status assertion and prints the reason.
  Chosen over panicking in middleware, which surfaces at the call site as a
  transport error and says nothing about which task or why.

  The allowlist is eight `auth/*` tasks with ALLOWED_COUNT asserted beside them —
  the same discipline as KNOWN_DRIFT_COUNT, because the cheapest way to make a
  failing check pass is to add a line to a list nobody watches. An allowlisted
  violation is still reported, pinned by a test: a list that suppressed the
  evidence would mean rediscovering each entry before it could be closed.

  Two existing guards caught mistakes of mine on the first run. The allowlist
  named login/{start,finish}/0.1 where the service binds 0.2 — built from the
  violation output rather than the route mounts — and the manifest guard flagged a
  fake `trusttasks.org/spec/` URI in a new unit test, correctly, since binding
  such a URI asserts the registry serves it.

  Also retargets relationships/{list,graph} to the 0.2s from
  trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#266, and fixes a seeder that wrote
  `seed-{uuid}` into `vrcDigestMultibase` — unique per row, and so a suite
  structurally blind to digest format.

  The VTC family is now clean; every remaining violation is `auth/*`.

### Fixed

- **tee**: Bootstrap 410 and vsock enotconn ([#1003](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1003))

* fix(tee): retry transient ENOTCONN on first vsock config-overlay read

  tokio-vsock can report a stream connected just before Nitro finishes the
  nonblocking handshake, so the very first read on a fresh vsock:5800
  connection to the parent config server can return ENOTCONN even though
  the parent is listening and ready. Retry only that specific transient
  error kind with a short delay; any other I/O error still fails closed
  immediately, and the existing overall READ_TIMEOUT deadline still
  bounds the whole fetch.

  Adds positive (retries ENOTCONN then succeeds) and negative (does not
  retry PermissionDenied) unit tests against the inner read loop.

### Added

- **nitro**: Un-bake tenant config, deliver to the enclave over vsock ([#939](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/939))

* feat(nitro): un-bake tenant config, deliver to the enclave over vsock

  The Nitro enclave image no longer bakes tenant config.toml into the EIF, so one image (one PCR0) serves every tenant. The entrypoint fetches a versioned config envelope from the parent over vsock:5800 (bounded connect/read timeouts, 1 MB size cap, version check), fails closed unless VTA_ALLOW_DEFAULT_CONFIG=true, and writes /etc/vta/config.toml before start. Adds jq to the runtime; documents the KMS-policy isolation requirement and the tee-mode enforcement floor.



## [0.1.6](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.5...vta-backup-v0.1.6) — 2026-08-13


### Added

- **release**: Publish vta-service and its closure again ([#962](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/962))

* feat(release): publish vta-service and its closure again

  #938 unpublished `vta-service` and the twelve subsystem crates behind it,
  on the finding that nothing external depended on them. The audit read
  normal dependencies. `openvtc-core` depends on `vta-service` as a
  **dev-dependency**, for `test_support::MockVta` — an in-process VTA its
  end-to-end tests run against. That harness boots the real service, so no
  client crate can stand in for it.

  Unpublishing did not merely freeze the crate. It broke it.

  `vti-common` re-exports `vta_sdk::acl::{ActScope, ApproveScope,
  ContextDirection}` as its own public API, so **a re-export makes the
  re-exported crate's version part of your public API**: any graph
  combining `vti-common` with another `vta-sdk` consumer must resolve one
  `vta-sdk`. The frozen `vta-service` 0.14.37 asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21`
  while `vti-common` has moved to `^0.23`. A downstream `cargo update`
  resolves both and `vta-service` fails to compile with

    expected `vti_common::acl::ApproveScope`,
       found `vta_sdk::acl::ApproveScope`

  at ten call sites — which is how this surfaced, in openvtc #213. Nothing
  downstream can fix that; only a release that moves the requirements
  together can.

  So the thirteen manifests go back to the workspace default. The cost is
  the closure — twelve subsystem crates return to crates.io, which is
  exactly what #938 set out to stop. Taken deliberately over the
  alternatives: yanking the published copies breaks OpenVTC's tests with no
  replacement, and leaving them up ships a crate on the registry that
  cannot be built.

  **On release ordering.** `cargo publish --dry-run -p vta-service` fails
  today, and will until the closure is on the registry: packaging strips
  path deps, so `vta-keys = "0.2"` resolves the *published* 0.2.1, which
  still asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21` — two nodes, same error. That resolves
  itself in the release, which publishes in dependency order: every
  subsystem crate in this workspace already requires `vta-sdk = "0.23"`, so
  once they upload, `vta-service` verifies against them. Crates whose
  dependencies are all published already dry-run clean (verified on
  `vta-keyspaces` and `vta-config`).

  Docs updated to match: CLAUDE.md, RELEASING.md and the release-plz.toml
  header all said 7-of-21. They now say 20-of-26, name the six that stay
  internal, and record the rule the audit missed — check dev-dependencies,
  in sibling repos, before unpublishing anything.



### Build & CI

- **release**: Adopt release-plz, publish 7 crates instead of 21 ([#938](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/938))

Merging and releasing were the same act. publish.yml fired on every push to
  main and shipped whatever versions were newly present, and a CI guard required
  the version bump to live in the feature PR — so every PR was a release
  decision, taken by whoever opened it, days before it merged. Two open PRs
  touching one crate wrote the same number into the same line of the same
  Cargo.toml, and the second to merge had to rebase, renumber, and fix a
  changelog entry that had gone stale. #932/#936/#937 hit it three times in one
  afternoon.
