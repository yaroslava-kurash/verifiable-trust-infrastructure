## [0.4.4](https://github.com/yaroslava-kurash/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.4.3...vta-backup-v0.4.4) — 2026-09-21


## [0.4.3](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.4.2...vta-backup-v0.4.3) — 2026-09-20


## [0.4.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.4.1...vta-backup-v0.4.2) — 2026-09-18


## [0.4.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.4.0...vta-backup-v0.4.1) — 2026-09-17


## [0.4.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.3.10...vta-backup-v0.4.0) — 2026-09-16


### Added

- **backup**: Back up a DIDComm/TSP-only VTA with the chunkedTrustTask algorithm ([#1522](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1522))

* build(deps): trust-tasks-rs 0.21.1, the release carrying the chunked backup specs

  0.21.1 is the first release with `vta/backup/get-chunk/1.0`,
  `put-chunk/1.0`, `initiate-{export,import}/1.1` and
  `finalize-import/1.1` (trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#474). A
  dispatched URI the registry has no schema for fails
  `every_served_uri_has_a_published_spec_or_is_tracked_debt`, so the floor
  moves with the tasks that need it.



## [0.3.10](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.3.9...vta-backup-v0.3.10) — 2026-09-16


### Fixed

- **backup**: Typed refusals for backup on a DIDComm/TSP-only VTA ([#1516](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1516))

The descriptor flow (`pnm backup export|import`) is REST-only: its
  `stream` algorithm moves the bytes over the VTA's HTTPS blob endpoint.
  A DIDComm/TSP-only VTA could not be backed up remotely, and every layer
  reported that badly.

  - SDK: `post_trust_task` refused DIDComm/TSP clients with `Validation`
    ("your request is wrong") although the same request succeeds over
    REST. It now returns `VtaError::UnsupportedTransport` naming
    `--transport rest`, as do `download_blob`/`upload_blob` when a client
    has no REST leg (their 429 → `RateLimited` mapping is unchanged). A
    DIDComm client's `rest_url` is still not used: it can come from the
    caller rather than from an advertised `VTARest` service, and the flow
    must not downgrade past what the peer advertises.
  - Server: a VTA with no `public_url` answered `initiate-*` with an opaque
    `internalError`, after already staging the bundle. It now refuses up
    front with the code `vta/backup/initiate-{export,import}/1.0` declare,
    `<slug>:transportUnavailable`, and the client maps that to
    `UnsupportedTransport`.
  - CLI: `--use-rest-legacy` on a DIDComm client silently sent the whole
    envelope as one mediator message (refused above 1 MiB, seen as a
    timeout). It now warns with the size caveat and `--transport rest`.
    Import no longer uploads the bytes twice: the commit finalizes the
    previewed bundle (new `VtaClient::backup_finalize_import`), and
    re-uploads only when the slot was already collected (not-found). A
    conflict is surfaced rather than retried, because it may mean "already
    committed" and commit is not idempotent.
  - retry_safety: initiate-export's reply carries the secret
    `transportToken`, not complete-export's; the classifications were
    swapped to match (initiate-export → KeyedSecret, complete-export →
    Keyed) so the token is never cached in the dedup store.
  - Docs: stale status line, non-existent offline `vta backup` command,
    the appstate note's claim that blobs work for DIDComm clients, the SDK
    "works on every transport" claim, and an operator note on backup for a
    DIDComm/TSP-only VTA. The planned transfer algorithm is renamed
    `chunkedTrustTask` (SPEC §4.10 casing) and specified upstream in
    trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#474.



## [0.3.9](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.3.8...vta-backup-v0.3.9) — 2026-09-16


## [0.3.8](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.3.7...vta-backup-v0.3.8) — 2026-09-12

## [0.3.5](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.3.4...vta-backup-v0.3.5) — 2026-09-09


## [0.3.4](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.3.3...vta-backup-v0.3.4) — 2026-09-07


## [0.3.3](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.3.2...vta-backup-v0.3.3) — 2026-09-07

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.3.0...vta-backup-v0.3.1) — 2026-08-29


## [0.3.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.2.0...vta-backup-v0.3.0) — 2026-08-28


### Chore

- **deps**: Aes-gcm 0.11, and stop the nonce conversions panicking ([#1173](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1173))
- **sdk**: Release vta-sdk 0.30.0 for the added CreateKeyBody field ([#1156](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1156))

`CreateKeyBody` gained a `key_id` field while the crate stayed at 0.29.0.
  The struct is exhaustively constructible through the public API, so an
  existing literal no longer compiles — a breaking change under 0.x rules,
  which the semver report has been flagging as its one real finding
  (195 pass, 1 fail) since the field landed.

  Bumps the crate and the nineteen intra-workspace requirements that pin it,
  so `cargo check --workspace` still resolves the path copy and a consumer
  resolving from the registry gets a version that admits the break.



## [0.2.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.14...vta-backup-v0.2.0) — 2026-08-26


### Added

- **app-state**: A third store for versioned, namespaced application state ([#1051](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1051))

Applications built on a VTA have had nowhere to keep versioned metadata.
  Adds `vta/app-state/{get,put,list,delete,get-many,put-many}/1.0` — a store
  beside the secrets vault and the credential vault, for JSON an application
  owns and the VTA does not interpret.

  Records are addressed `(contextId, namespace, key)`. The namespace scopes one
  application so several tools can share a context without colliding, and is the
  seam a per-namespace grant would later use — which is why it is part of the
  address rather than a prefix convention on the key. In 1.0 a namespace is
  collision avoidance and NOT a trust boundary: an application with write access
  to a context reaches every namespace in it, and the `put` and `delete` specs
  say so normatively. Isolation means separate contexts.

  Deliberately not built on `vta/memory/*`. `MemoryItem` is `{key, value}` with
  nothing to hang a precondition on, and its `list` returns the whole context —
  but the argument that settles it is that "forget everything" has to stay a safe
  thing to ask an agent, which it cannot be if account state lives there.

  Three properties are why this is a store rather than a field on an existing one.

  **One counter per `(contextId, namespace)`, not per record.** A record's
  `version` is the counter value its most recent write took, so one number is
  simultaneously the optimistic-concurrency token `expectedVersion` compares
  against and the watermark `sinceVersion` compares against. A per-record counter
  serves the first but cannot serve the second — two records' counters are not
  comparable, so no single number means "everything after this point" — and would
  have forced a second sequence kept consistent by hand. The cost is that a
  record's version jumps by whatever its neighbours consumed, which the wire
  contract states: versions are opaque and monotonic, never an edit count.

  **A failed precondition returns the current version AND value.** A bare
  rejection obliges a re-read, and the re-read races the next write; the pattern
  has no fixed point under contention. Returning the winner's view removes the
  race rather than narrowing it, and the spec makes it normative.

  **Delete leaves a versioned tombstone, and the tombstones are reaped.** Without
  one, a consumer pulling from a watermark learns of every create and update and
  never of a deletion, so deleted records resurrect on its next rebuild.
  Retention is `app_state.tombstone_retention_days` (default 30, matching the
  vault's `grace_days`) — a destructive window is an operator's choice, not a
  constant — and `list` advertises the configured value, since a consumer
  schedules against that number. The sweeper runs from the storage thread beside
  the ACL/consent/vault sweepers.

  The sweeper reaps a *prefix*, not a set: each namespace walks its tombstones in
  version order and stops at the first still inside the window. Reaping a later
  tombstone while leaving an earlier one would make the reap watermark
  unstateable — no single number would describe what survives, which is precisely
  what `watermarkTooOld` has to be able to say. `0` days disables reaping, and
  that is enforced at the call site rather than as a zero cutoff, which would mean
  the opposite.

  Version reservation is fsynced and re-seals the TEE integrity manifest, for the
  reason `vti_common::store::counter` gives for BIP-32 counters: a counter
  surviving only in the journal buffer can be re-derived after a crash and reissue
  a used value. Here a reused version means two records collide on one `appv:`
  index key, so one disappears from the change feed and every incremental consumer
  misses that change permanently, silently. A batch reserves a block and pays one
  fsync rather than N; writes that then fail leave gaps, which are safe and
  tested.

  Retry safety: reads are `ReadOnly`, `delete` is `RetrySafe` (a second delete
  finds a tombstone and deliberately takes no new version, so a watcher sees
  nothing), and `put`/`put-many` are `Keyed` — a `put` without `expectedVersion`
  does not converge, and the class is per URI, not per payload.

  Blobs are deliberately out of scope in 1.0; adding a `blobRef` is additive.

  Concurrency is a process-local lock per namespace, not a store-layer
  compare-and-swap. fjall takes an exclusive database lock so two processes cannot
  share a store, and the vsock protocol has no atomic opcode — its
  `insert_if_absent`/`swap` are already non-atomic fallbacks. A CAS today would be
  atomic exactly where the lock suffices and a warn-and-fallback exactly where it
  would need to be real. Recorded in the design note with what would change that.

  Schemas published upstream as trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#252 and #253;
  this depends on the released trust-tasks-rs 0.11.2, pinned to a minimum patch so
  an older resolve fails as a stale dependency rather than as unspecced URIs.
  Conformance witnesses cover all six URIs, so nothing enters
  `UNSPECCED_DISPATCHED_URIS`.



### Fixed

- **vtc**: Follow the spec on every auth response, and close the conformance gate ([#1112](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1112))

* test(vtc)!: make response conformance fail the build

  Until now the layer reported and a green suite was not evidence of
  conformance — #1107's own memory note said to grep the run rather than trust
  the exit code, which is a signal nobody has to obey.

  A violation outside the allowlist now returns 500 with the schema error, so the
  test that provoked it fails on its own status assertion and prints the reason.
  Chosen over panicking in middleware, which surfaces at the call site as a
  transport error and says nothing about which task or why.

  The allowlist is eight `auth/*` tasks with ALLOWED_COUNT asserted beside them —
  the same discipline as KNOWN_DRIFT_COUNT, because the cheapest way to make a
  failing check pass is to add a line to a list nobody watches. An allowlisted
  violation is still reported, pinned by a test: a list that suppressed the
  evidence would mean rediscovering each entry before it could be closed.

  Two existing guards caught mistakes of mine on the first run. The allowlist
  named login/{start,finish}/0.1 where the service binds 0.2 — built from the
  violation output rather than the route mounts — and the manifest guard flagged a
  fake `trusttasks.org/spec/` URI in a new unit test, correctly, since binding
  such a URI asserts the registry serves it.

  Also retargets relationships/{list,graph} to the 0.2s from
  trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#266, and fixes a seeder that wrote
  `seed-{uuid}` into `vrcDigestMultibase` — unique per row, and so a suite
  structurally blind to digest format.

  The VTC family is now clean; every remaining violation is `auth/*`.



## [0.1.14](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.13...vta-backup-v0.1.14) — 2026-08-22


## [0.1.13](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.12...vta-backup-v0.1.13) — 2026-08-21


## [0.1.12](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.11...vta-backup-v0.1.12) — 2026-08-20


### Fixed

- **tee**: Bootstrap 410 and vsock enotconn ([#1003](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1003))

* fix(tee): retry transient ENOTCONN on first vsock config-overlay read

  tokio-vsock can report a stream connected just before Nitro finishes the
  nonblocking handshake, so the very first read on a fresh vsock:5800
  connection to the parent config server can return ENOTCONN even though
  the parent is listening and ready. Retry only that specific transient
  error kind with a short delay; any other I/O error still fails closed
  immediately, and the existing overall READ_TIMEOUT deadline still
  bounds the whole fetch.

  Adds positive (retries ENOTCONN then succeeds) and negative (does not
  retry PermissionDenied) unit tests against the inner read loop.



## [0.1.11](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.10...vta-backup-v0.1.11) — 2026-08-18


## [0.1.10](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.9...vta-backup-v0.1.10) — 2026-08-17


## [0.1.9](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.8...vta-backup-v0.1.9) — 2026-08-16


## [0.1.8](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.7...vta-backup-v0.1.8) — 2026-08-16


## [0.1.7](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.6...vta-backup-v0.1.7) — 2026-08-14


### Added

- **nitro**: Un-bake tenant config, deliver to the enclave over vsock ([#939](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/939))

* feat(nitro): un-bake tenant config, deliver to the enclave over vsock

  The Nitro enclave image no longer bakes tenant config.toml into the EIF, so one image (one PCR0) serves every tenant. The entrypoint fetches a versioned config envelope from the parent over vsock:5800 (bounded connect/read timeouts, 1 MB size cap, version check), fails closed unless VTA_ALLOW_DEFAULT_CONFIG=true, and writes /etc/vta/config.toml before start. Adds jq to the runtime; documents the KMS-policy isolation requirement and the tee-mode enforcement floor.



## [0.1.6](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-backup-v0.1.5...vta-backup-v0.1.6) — 2026-08-13


### Added

- **release**: Publish vta-service and its closure again ([#962](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/962))

* feat(release): publish vta-service and its closure again

  #938 unpublished `vta-service` and the twelve subsystem crates behind it,
  on the finding that nothing external depended on them. The audit read
  normal dependencies. `openvtc-core` depends on `vta-service` as a
  **dev-dependency**, for `test_support::MockVta` — an in-process VTA its
  end-to-end tests run against. That harness boots the real service, so no
  client crate can stand in for it.

  Unpublishing did not merely freeze the crate. It broke it.

  `vti-common` re-exports `vta_sdk::acl::{ActScope, ApproveScope,
  ContextDirection}` as its own public API, so **a re-export makes the
  re-exported crate's version part of your public API**: any graph
  combining `vti-common` with another `vta-sdk` consumer must resolve one
  `vta-sdk`. The frozen `vta-service` 0.14.37 asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21`
  while `vti-common` has moved to `^0.23`. A downstream `cargo update`
  resolves both and `vta-service` fails to compile with

    expected `vti_common::acl::ApproveScope`,
       found `vta_sdk::acl::ApproveScope`

  at ten call sites — which is how this surfaced, in openvtc #213. Nothing
  downstream can fix that; only a release that moves the requirements
  together can.

  So the thirteen manifests go back to the workspace default. The cost is
  the closure — twelve subsystem crates return to crates.io, which is
  exactly what #938 set out to stop. Taken deliberately over the
  alternatives: yanking the published copies breaks OpenVTC's tests with no
  replacement, and leaving them up ships a crate on the registry that
  cannot be built.

  **On release ordering.** `cargo publish --dry-run -p vta-service` fails
  today, and will until the closure is on the registry: packaging strips
  path deps, so `vta-keys = "0.2"` resolves the *published* 0.2.1, which
  still asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21` — two nodes, same error. That resolves
  itself in the release, which publishes in dependency order: every
  subsystem crate in this workspace already requires `vta-sdk = "0.23"`, so
  once they upload, `vta-service` verifies against them. Crates whose
  dependencies are all published already dry-run clean (verified on
  `vta-keyspaces` and `vta-config`).

  Docs updated to match: CLAUDE.md, RELEASING.md and the release-plz.toml
  header all said 7-of-21. They now say 20-of-26, name the six that stay
  internal, and record the rule the audit missed — check dev-dependencies,
  in sibling repos, before unpublishing anything.



### Build & CI

- **release**: Adopt release-plz, publish 7 crates instead of 21 ([#938](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/938))

Merging and releasing were the same act. publish.yml fired on every push to
  main and shipped whatever versions were newly present, and a CI guard required
  the version bump to live in the feature PR — so every PR was a release
  decision, taken by whoever opened it, days before it merged. Two open PRs
  touching one crate wrote the same number into the same line of the same
  Cargo.toml, and the second to merge had to rebase, renumber, and fix a
  changelog entry that had gone stale. #932/#936/#937 hit it three times in one
  afternoon.
